The timing of Cohen\\u2019s testimony was first reported by NBC. Cohen confirmed that he would testify to the committee on Tuesday and said he did not know whether it would be in a closed session or public. Aides to the committee\\u2019s leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen said previously he had received a subpoena from at least one of the congressional committees investigating what U.S. intelligence has determined were Russia\\u2019s efforts to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia denies such activity. The White House denies any collusion, but concerns about the issue and Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia have shadowed the first months of the Republican\\u2019s presidency. Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, would be one of a series of close associates of the president to testify in Congress. Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives committees conducting investigations have said they expect to call more. Trump\\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s main opposition leader said on Monday President Robert Mugabe s refusal to resign had dampened people s spirits and called for an inclusive political process in the aftermath of a military intervention last week.

It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  Beasley told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued.  It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  he told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there.  Racism, racial harassment can occur really anywhere even in a black-owned business,  he asserted. Beasley added,  You can t treat people like that and get away with it constantly.

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Titles: [b'Just a few days after being sworn in as president, Donald J. Trump convened a meeting at the White House of some of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most prominent chief executives to discuss how to improve manufacturing. Mr. Trump was joined by Elon Musk of Tesla, Mark Fields of Ford, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, Marillyn A. Hewson of Lockheed Martin and Michael Dell of Dell, among others. Before the meeting formally began, with cameras rolling, Mr. Trump wanted to talk about corporate tax rates  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   specifically lowering them. During one debate with Hillary Clinton, he had told voters: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnder my plan, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a job creator like we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen since Ronald Reagan. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d He repeated the 15 percent figure over and over again. However, when Mr. Trump spoke to the C. E. O.s that morning, he shifted the goal post slightly: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20 percent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Inside the White House, until last Friday, according to people involved in the conversations, the target rate had been bumped up again, to a minimum of 20 percent and very likely a bit more. And now, given that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is off the table  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and with it the $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years that the administration needed to help make its tax plan deficit neutral  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   there is a good chance that any tax package would include a corporate rate that is even further from Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial pledge, perhaps as high as 28 percent. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take my word for it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the figure that Grover Norquist, the   activist who is the president of Americans for Tax Reform, and who has long sought the lowest rate possible, has calculated would be needed for the plan to be deficit neutral after 10 years. That way it could come under the heading of budget reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority. If the 28 percent corporate tax rate sounds familiar, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because it is: It was the same rate that President Barack Obama proposed in 2012 and again in 2013, when he also proposed to lower the tax rate for United States manufacturers to 25 percent. He made the proposal again in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Each time, his tax plan was summarily dismissed by Republicans who called the rate too high and uncompetitive. Now, Republicans may end up negotiating a tax package with a corporate tax rate that looks a lot like the one they rejected out of hand for the last five years. Why is the rate so important? Because almost all those on Wall Street  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and in corner offices throughout corporate America  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   have been baking into their models a tax reform plan that they say will   additional investments, leading to higher growth in the economy. As an example, Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of ATT, told analysts this year, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know at ATT that if you saw tax rates move to 20 percent to 25 percent, we know what we would do: We would step up our investment levels. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some of those investments become harder to justify if the rate is higher, executives say. The Standard  Poor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s   index already has an effective tax rate of about 28 percent, according to WalletHub. The United States has the highest top statutory corporate tax rate among Group of 20 nations, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office. As evidenced by the stock market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pullback on Friday and again on Monday, investors and analysts are redoing their math to account for the fact that tax reform may not happen as soon as they expected  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   the Trump administration had said it would happen by August  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and that rates will not come down as much as had been anticipated. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who oversaw the effort to repeal Obamacare, acknowledged that the bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmake tax reform more difficult. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d He has yet to publish a new set of corporate tax rates, but his original plan called for a rate of 20 percent. That plan depended not only on Obamacare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s repeal, to save $1 trillion, but also on another plan that seems increasingly unlikely to gain support: a   border adjustment tax  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   a euphemism for an import tax on all goods  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   that was expected to raise another $1 trillion over 10 years. The border adjustment tax, an obsession of Mr. Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, has divided Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advisers. Stephen K. Bannon has been a proponent, seeing it as an incentive for more companies to make goods here in the United States. Others, like Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin, have been more ambivalent, people involved in the discussions say, in part because other countries could retaliate, making it harder for United States manufacturers to export goods. Many American retailers, like Walmart, and even some manufacturers  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   including Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which make some car models in Mexico and Canada and import them into this country  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   have expressed their anxiety about how a border adjustment tax would affect their business. Given the squabbling within the Republican Party over the repeal of Obamacare, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to imagine that a congressman with constituents including big retailers  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   retail jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in the United States by about four to one  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   would vote in favor of a border adjustment tax. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe border adjustment tax, the most controversial piece of current   discussions, is less likely to pass,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Soci\\xc3\\xa9t\\xc3\\xa9 G\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa9rale wrote in a note to clients over the weekend. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Congress fails to approve tax reform ahead of August, confidence is likely to slip. Congress could still pass a bill by the end of the calendar year, but even that could slip. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Without the $2 trillion in revenue and tax savings that the border adjustment tax and Obamacare repeal would generate, it is virtually impossible to see how the Trump administration could find a path to a corporate tax rate anywhere near what it originally promised. (Of course, the administration could pull back on its pledge to lower taxes for the middle class, but that seems unlikely.) The   question is whether lowering corporate taxes would ultimately have the desired effect. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile there is no doubt that tax policy can influence economic choices,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a study by the Brookings Institution determined, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is by no means obvious, on an ex ante basis, that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",
            " b'A recent U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report reveals the information technology (IT) used by the government is ineffective to keep tabs on those who overstay visas. Moreover, the lag also causes a delay in determining whether a visa holder poses a national security threat. There is a backlog of more than 1. 2 million visa overstays. [Auditors with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at DHS found that U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigations \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay take months\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to determine both a visa holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s status and whether they are a threat to public safety.  According to a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas from the DHS Office of Inspector General, the IT scheme that exists presently \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforc[es] ICE personnel to laboriously piece together vital information from up to 27 distinct DHS information systems and databases to accurately determine an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overstay status. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The system lacks \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintegration and   capabilities. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The result: a stockpile of more than 1. 2 million visa overstay cases. Another problem in keeping track of visa overstays is the absence of a biometric system at the U. S. ports of departure. Immigration experts with the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) reported in September 2013: Tracking the arrival and departure of foreign visitors to the United States is an essential part of immigration control. The need for arrival controls is obvious, but recording departures is also important without it, there is no way to know whether travelers have left when they were supposed to. It is also vital that such exit tracking employs biometric indicators  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   for instance, the travelers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 photos or fingerprints. Using only biographic information, such as names or passport numbers, provides no assurance that the person departing is the one whose original arrival was recorded. CIS reported that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca biometric   system for aliens departing by air or sea is feasible immediately at a reasonable cost. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Estimates, based on the costs at the time, showed that implementation expenses for the first year would range from $400 million to $600 million. This estimate included significant cost overruns. The immigration think tank suggested that implementation could be covered with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelatively small fee increase\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on those charged to foreign nationals who come to the country via air or sea. They wrote that the expense very likely would not require a congressional appropriation. There are 40 million of these individuals who travel by air. Moreover, CIS reported that as of September 2013, 14 countries already had, or were in the process of getting, biometric systems for air travelers. ICE officials have now been given the responsibility of identifying those who overstay their visa. The workload \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould be minimal with a biometric exit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d system and this would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenable the agency to focus on enforcing the law rather than diverting hundreds of agents to this task as it does now. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The   program used to be charged with determining visa overstays. ICE was given this responsibility in 2013 when the then   program was divested of it. CIS reports that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe executive branch has so far refused to implement such a system. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yet, CIS reports Congress directed that an exit system be set up (in eight different statutes since 1996) and the three most recent legislative mandates require a biometric component. Although the cost has likely increased since 2013, many immigration experts would probably urge that so has the risks to Americans. Officials already capture these facial images and fingerprints at airports of entry and consular offices when foreign nationals are seeking to come into the U. S. CIS reports this information is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cqueried an average of 30, 000 times every day by authorized federal, state, and local government users. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d This information is used by intelligence officers and law enforcement and is shared with other countries to arrest criminals and terrorists who change their names and other information to get safely lost in the U. S. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cICE must equip its personnel with the tools and training they require for the vital work of tracking visitors who overstay their visas,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Inspector General John Roth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTimely identification, tracking, and adjudication of potential visa overstays is critical to ICE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public safety and national security mission. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

            " b'NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s Supreme Court will rule on Monday on cases that seek to nullify the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta last month and the judges could order a fresh vote or clear the way for the incumbent to be sworn in for a second term. The two cases appear to represent a final chance for legal scrutiny of the Oct. 26 election and the ruling could end a protracted political crisis in which more than 60 people have been killed. Kenya is a hub for trade, diplomacy and security in East Africa.  We will deliver judgment on the 20th,  Chief Justice David Maraga told lawyers at the end of a hearing on Thursday. Kenyatta defeated opposition leader Raila Odinga in August but Odinga challenged the election and the court voided it citing procedural irregularities and ordered a fresh vote. The court s decision was the first of its kind in Africa. Odinga boycotted last month s poll, saying the election commission had failed to carry out sufficient reforms. Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote. Lawyers for the petitioners, a former lawmaker and two human rights activists, urged the court to nullify the repeat poll due to a lack of fresh nominations for candidates and violence in some areas that prevented voting. Their counterparts for the election board, its chairman and Kenyatta, rejected the petition and urged the court to uphold the result to help end a crisis that has hurt the economy. The Supreme Court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a crisis over a disputed election in 2007 in which around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic clashes. Analysts said the September ruling by the Supreme Court could embolden other judiciaries in Africa. This month, Liberia s Supreme Court halted a presidential run-off until the election board investigates claims of fraud in the first round of voting. '\n",
            " b'Republican Presidential front runner Donald Trump has one of the worst honesty ratings of any politician evaluated in the history of Politifact. Yet, he has just launched an attack on Ted Cruz asking: How can Ted Cruz be an evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2016Firstly, asked by a candidate of integrity, or a voter, this is a totally acceptable question. Ted Cruz and the entire Christian Conservative movement fly in the face of the teachings of Jesus. Turning the other cheek, forgiveness, compassion, charity, community, the corrupting influence of wealth, the baselessness of individuality   all of these teachings were totally abandoned. Republican Jesus is actually evangelical libertarian Ayn Rand, and their bible is her book, Atlas Shrugged.However, for trust fund tycoon Donald Trump, this attack is nothing short of the single most hypocritical question of the campaign. Donald Trump is a lying liar who lies. Don t take our word for it. Check out his file on fact checking site Politifact.Just 1% of claims made by Donald Trump are true. One percent! Meanwhile, 3 out of every 5 statements he makes are absolute lies. Let s take a look back at some of those lies:They just keep on coming.And on the matter of faith, Donald Trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical. Yet, Trump has been married three times, pokes fun of Holy Communion as eating  the little cracker , claims he has never asked God to forgive his sins in his life, and could not name a single passage of the Bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture.Trump is about as devout a Christian as Bill Nye.And yet, he is winning evangelical support in droves. Why? Because the evangelical, Christian Conservative movement has zero to do with faith in God, and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right-wing principles of crony capitalism, white supremacy, homophobia and sexism.If this was not the case, Trump would be the LAST candidate that appealed to Evangelicals. To any right-thinking Christian, he is the 21st century incarnation of the Whore of Babylon.If this contest is going to come down to Ted Cruz or Donald Trump, the Republican party is really being asked whether to die by lethal injection or firing squad. Either way, the party is going to end up dead.Featured Image via T. J. Hawk (Flickr Creative Commons)'\n",
            " b'After dropping out of the Republican presidential race, Dr. Ben Carson made the quick shift to endorse Donald Trump. He insists that Trump is the best person for the job, besides himself of course, because he s an  outsider  who will supposedly get us away from the status quo. However, upon his recent visit to The Daily Show, Carson just made a perfect case against voting for Trump.Daily Show host Trevor Noah wasted absolutely no time in getting to the pressing question of why Carson chose to endorse Trump, saying the neurosurgeon must think  he can only be president for four years, so it can t be that bad. Carson s response was actually a far worse reason that Noah s joke, he said: What I actually said is that would be the worst-case scenario. Which left the audience not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and the sound that emanated from the crowd indicated it was probably a hybrid of the two.Yet, after discussing the supposed two different versions of Trump that exist, Carson said something that could make people stop and think twice before casting their ballot for Trump, because it s clear that Carson s vision of and for America is very different from that of the Republican front-runner s. He said: We are the child of every other nation, so we should have the welfare of every other nation at heart and conduct ourselves in a very different way. And if we can learn from them and we can conduct ourselves in a way that demonstrates compassion towards others, I believe that it can be a dawning of a new world. To which Noah responded as we all likely would with,  I hope Donald Trump is watching this show,  because that is certainly a message of inclusiveness that needs to be heard, and a far step away from the divisive, xenophobic rhetoric that Trump has been touting daily.It looks as though Carson may want to rethink who he s throwing his support behind.Watch the whole segment here:Featured image via video screen capture'\n",

            " b'We have some bad news for Charles Koch: Hillary Clinton just isn t that into you. Recently, the evil billionaire backer of the Tea Party announced that Republicans are so terrible, he is forced to admit that Hillary Clinton is possibly better than all of them. Koch told ABC s This Week that Clinton s husband was a much better President in terms of government spending than was George W. Bush, who is idolized by many conservatives. In some ways. In other ways, I mean he wasn t an exemplar. But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was 2.5 times under Bush than it was under Clinton,  Koch said, explaining that for Hillary to be a better President than the entire Republican field, she would have to be a gigantic hypocrite who can be bought and sold like everyone else they back. Asked if he would support her campaign for President, Koch said: We would have to believe her actions would be quite different from her rhetoric, let me put it that way. While Koch is in love with Clinton as anyone on the Right is going to get, he probably should not expect much from her. On Sunday, Clinton let the Koch brothers know what she thinks of them and their money by essentially telling Charles to go f*ck himself.Referencing the Kochs  climate denial and attempts to suppress minority voters, Clinton explained that she could not accept an endorsement from someone so evil.  Not interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote,  she said, linking the interview.Yes, it s no secret that the Republican field is chock-full of terribleness, but Koch is almost certainly not going to find any friends among Democrats these days.

The answer to this question is simple. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because Clinton doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that these interventions went wrong. And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment. (aka\\xe2\\x80\\x93The Borg). In fact, in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success. Sure, a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq, (or the logistical errors, like disbanding the Iraqi Army) but\\xe2\\x80\\x93for the most part\\xe2\\x80\\x93 the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diktats. This is hard for ordinary people to understand. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 15 year-long rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all this? First, we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan. If it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t part of a plan, than the decision-makers would change the policy. But they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed the policy. The policy is the same. The fact that the US is using foreign-born jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq, is not a fundamental change in the policy. The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government. This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions. But why? What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death? Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I think: I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents, the international banks and multinational corporations. Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening quote, he also explains what is taking place: The nation-state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests. Instead, Washington is erasing borders, liquidating states, and removing strong, secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region, a new world order. The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected-global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital, in other words, a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury, mutual debt, federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly. Deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought-and-paid-for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s energy supplies, the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reserve currency and become the dominant player in this century\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most populous and prosperous region, Asia. This is essentially what Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpivot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Asia is all about. The basic problem with Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it. This is what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really going on in Syria, the improbable alliance of Russia, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks. The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed\\xe2\\x80\\xa6so far. Naturally, the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments, and for good reason. The US has run the world for quite a while now, so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat. The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September, but only recently has Washington shown that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country, Raqqa. But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when the US will directly engage Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be contained within Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borders. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a risky plan, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the next logical step in this bloody fiasco. Neither party wants a nuclear war, but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down, therefore, Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo-fly zone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, anyone? The assumption is that eventually, and with enough pressure, Putin will throw in the towel. But this is another miscalculation. Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not it at all. Putin is in Syria because he has no choice. Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security is at stake. If Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds, then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia. Putin knows this, just like he knows that the scourge of foreign-backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya. He knows that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow. So he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t back down, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an option. But, by the same token, he can compromise, in other words, his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide. For example, he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not support. But why would he do that? Why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he continue to fight until every inch of Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sovereign territory is recovered? Because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not in Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national interest to do so, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why. Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in Syria to protect Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his main objective. But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an idealist, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pragmatist who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP. That means compromise. This doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter to the Washington warlords\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.yet. But it will eventually. Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort. No one is going to get everything they want, that much is certain. For example, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria. In fact, Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings. But that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that Putin doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have his red lines. He does. Aleppo is a red line. Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter Aleppo. The western corridor, the industrial and population centers are all red lines. On these, there will be no compromise. Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact. But will Turkey control sections in the north, and will the US control sections in the east? Probably. This will have to be worked out in negotiations, but its unlikely that the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out. Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored. In any event, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to hang around until the last dog is hung. Unfortunately, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a long way from any settlement in Syria, mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the crux of the matter, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? The bigshots who run the country are still in denial.

            " b'Evil hiding under the banner of  religion  in our own backyard A 32-year-old woman was harassed and intimidated last week when she tried to pick up her four children from the fundamentalist Mormon sect she bravely left to escape an abusive husband.Sabrina Broadbent Tetzner, 32, fled the sect headed by convicted rapist Warren Jeffs eight years ago and finally gained full custody of her children (ages 8 to 13) last week.But when she tried to pick up her children from the Colorado City, Utah community where they have been living, she was physically stopped by hundreds of cult members hell bent on keeping the kids. Lots of members from the community started showing up. They surrounded her vehicle, the home, fences and the yard. They were kicking the van. They even tried to put a cow and chickens into her vehicle,  ex-cult member Flora Jessop, who helped Tetzner through her legal battle, told KSL.Cell phone footage shows swarms of polygamists surrounding Tetzner s van, the women dressed in conservative floor-length dresses in varying pastel colors. A Mohave County judge ordered the sect to turn over the children at 5pm Thursday, but Tetzner says that when she got to the compound at the arranged time her kids were nowhere to be seen. FOX 10 News | fox10phoenix.comIt was only at midnight that they returned, and were quickly shepherded into their aunt Samantha Holm s house where several dozen fundamentalists kept them from seeing her mother.Tetzner spent the night in her van, fearing the vehicle would be torn apart if she left it unattended. When even about 600 cult members surrounded her vehicle in the morning, and kept her from reaching the home where her children were staying, Tetzner called police to intervene on her children s behalf. Sheriff s deputies had to take out a search warrant to pry the children from the house and into their mother s waiting arms.Allegedly, the children were not so happy to leave, since cult members had scared them into believing their mother was taking them to hell. Deputies escorted Tetzner and her children all the way back to their home in northern Utah, and reportedly FLDS members tailed them the whole way there.Since leaving the sect, she has remarried a man named Chase Tetzner and the two appear to have a toddler son together. A photo posted to her Facebook in August 2012, shows her in a half-white, half-camouflage wedding dress.Defenders of Children, a non-profit group that has been aiding Tetzner through her custody battle, said they fear for her safety and are raising money to pay for a security system and new clothes for the woman s children. Tetzner left the FLDS church eight years ago, about a year after the cult s leader Warren Jeffs was arrested for organizing marriages between men in his cult and underage girls. He is currently serving a life sentence in prison, but continues to head the church from behind bars.Custodial interference charges are pending against Samantha Holm, the aunt who initially wouldn t hand over Tetzner s children.Via: UK Daily Mail'\n",
            " b'SANDY SPRINGS, Ga., April 18 (Reuters)   For U.S. President Donald Trump, an off-year congressional election on Tuesday in the reliably Republican northern suburbs of Atlanta could spell trouble if Democratic upstart Jon Ossoff pulls off a surprise victory.Watch MSNBC Morning Joe show hosts and guest attempt to contain their excitement over the possibility of a Democrat winning the seat of former House Leader Newt Gingrich and now, in a special election they are hoping to replace Tom Price s Georgia s 6th District seat:Donald Trump is actively campaigning against Ossoff on social media:Republicans must get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6. Force runoff and easy win! Dem Ossoff will raise your taxes-very bad on crime & 2nd A.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2017A 30-year-old political novice, Ossoff is running as the lone Democrat against a field of 17 Republicans for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives vacated when Trump named Tom Price to be secretary of health and human services.The outcome will not tip the balance of power in the Republican-controlled House. But an Ossoff win could weaken Trump s already shaky hold on his fellow Republicans in the House by encouraging those in competitive districts to distance themselves from the president.The Democrats are in the fight of their lives. They re pulling out all of the stops, as they believe a win in this traditionally  red  district of Georgia would be a huge black eye for President Trump. Is anyone really surprised that voter machines from this district have been stolen only days before what Democrats are calling a  must win  election?Channel 2 Action News has learned that critical voting machines were stolen just days before polls will open for a special election.State officials are investigating after equipment was taken from a Cobb County precinct manager s vehicle. According to Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the equipment was stolen on Saturday evening while the vehicle was parked at the Kroger on Canton Road.Kemp s office says Cobb County Elections waited two days to tell his office about the theft of the machines.The four so-called ExpressPoll machines were the computers poll workers used to check-in voters, and check those off who cast ballots. It s very shocking, especially with the climate we have of voter fraud out there,  one Georgia voter told Channel 2 s Ross Cavitt.Cobb County Elections Director Janine Eveler said the stolen machines cannot be used to fraudulently vote in Tuesday s election. Eveler said the machines have voter information on them, but that information is  hard to access. Eveler said they will completely replace the machines at the Piedmont Road precinct. '\n",
            " b'The chances of Donald Trump becoming the Republican nominee for president have gone from impossible to probable, while Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chances of being the Democrat have moved from likely to virtually certain. So, barring more surprises, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably going to be Hillary vs. The Donald in the fall.\\n\\nThere is no mystery about Clinton. Those who support her as well as those who oppose her have little trouble explaining why. Trump is another matter. No one I know would even consider voting for Trump. So who are all these millions who support him? Why, they are working-class white men, we are told, who feel betrayed by the failure of both parties to deal with stagnant incomes, growing debts and shrinking possibilities for their retirements and their childrens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 futures.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a plausible theory. And it may help to explain Bernie Sanders. But no one has ever associated Trump with these blue-collar issues. How has he become the tribune of the people in this election? Is he just the one who got there first?\\n\\nThe explanation is not so difficult. In the opening paragraph of his novel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRavelstein,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saul Bellow writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyone who wants to govern the country has to entertain it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clinton has been called many things, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9centertaining\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not one of them. This is not the case with Trump, who is an authentic American character like something out of Mark Twain. All the other candidates except Sanders had the character squeezed out of them when they decided they wanted to be president. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a phony of course (not to mention a racist), but his phoniness is authentic. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-made \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not in the financial sense, but characterologically.\\n\\nAnd what a character! You always want to know what he will say or do next. To be sure, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job to keep the citizenry entertained, although voting on the basis of entertainment value is not entirely irrational, given that entertainment is the main benefit you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re likely to get from our political system. Anyway, not knowing what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do next does have its charms, and they go beyond entertainment.\\n\\nDuring the nuclear standoff of the 1960s and 1970s, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger took advantage of a doctrine out of the branch of economics known as game theory, which holds that sometimes it pays to be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or at least to be perceived to be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 crazy. No rational person would ever start a nuclear war. So the one who can get the other side to back down in any future nuclear standoff is the one who convinces the world that he or she is more irrational. Vladimir Putin has done a pretty good job here, you have to admit. Imagine Putin and any of the American presidential candidates facing each other across the nuclear divide, each threatening to push the button unless their demands are met. Which of the Americans is crazy enough to actually do it?\\n\\nWhen Barack Obama proposes something, you know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been analyzed and balanced and weighed against the alternatives, tested in the laboratory and found to be a reasonable solution given the limitations and under the circumstances. When Trump faces some similar challenge, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to say or do. And if he says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do something crazy, like get the Mexicans to pay for a wall across their own country to keep themselves out of ours, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be sure he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually try to do it.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear now that the title of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Art of the Deal \\xe2\\x80\\x9d actually reflects a philosophy of life: Trump believes that everything in life is a negotiation, a deal, and he believes that making deals uses skills that he has and his rivals lack. This is why he may even have been sincere in his puzzlement about why the media has been so insistent that he reveal his tax returns. Paying taxes, like so much else in life, is a negotiation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least at Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level. And why would you give your opponent a major document, whether it reveals misbehavior or not? What is misbehavior, for that matter? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all up for negotiation.\\n\\nPeople (read: liberals) are afraid of what Trump might do as president. All this silly talk about moving to Canada. But the thing to really worry about in a Trump presidency is what happens a couple of years from now, when people who have invested their hopes in Trump and his magic tricks discover that he is not the Wizard of Oz but rather the man behind the curtain.'\n",

On Twitter early on Thursday, Trump wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMexico will pay for the wall!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That prompted a Twitter reply from Pena Nieto later in the day: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI repeat what I told you personally Mr Trump, Mexico would never pay for a wall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump has sparked anger in Mexico with accusations on the campaign trail that the country sends rapists and drug runners to the United States, as well as his threats to tear up trade deals and make Mexico fund his planned wall. At a news conference after their 70-minute meeting, Trump said he and Pena Nieto had not discussed who would pay for the wall he wants to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing the border. A few hours later, Pena Nieto contradicted Trump, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill. However, Trump told a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona later on Wednesday that Mexico would pay for the wall \\xe2\\x80\\x9c100 percent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After Trump had left Mexico, Pena Nieto was at pains to stress how he had brought home to the New York businessman the offense his comments have caused, calling his proposals a threat to the country. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was very clear - in private and in public - in stressing that in Mexico we feel offended and hurt by his pronouncements about Mexicans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pena Nieto wrote in a piece in the newspaper El Universal on Thursday entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy did I meet Donald Trump?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn his campaign speeches, Trump has not treated us like partners, nor as allies, based on a distorted picture of Mexico and its people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on, saying he had told Trump future cooperation between the two nations must be based on mutual respect. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDonald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reaction was positive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.

Lindsey Graham ( ) raised concerns that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had hired a former Clinton Foundation attorney to assist with the probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [Graham was questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was sitting in for Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Democrats have long accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia, though no evidence has emerged. There is also speculation that Special Counsel Mueller will probe allegations of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, reports emerged that Mueller had hired attorneys for his investigative team who had donated to Hillary Clinton in the past, and one in particular who had represented the Clinton Foundation in its effort to block Freedom of Information Act requests for   on Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private server. Graham: Is giving political donations a reason to disqualify somebody for serving in the Special Counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office? Rosenstein: No, Senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not. Graham: As a matter of fact, many states, the judges and prosecutors are actually elected. Donations are a part of that system, is that correct? Rosenstein: Yes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. Graham: Would it be a disqualification for somebody in the Special Counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office who had represented Mrs. Clinton in the past to serve? Rosenstein: You know, Senator, it would depend on facts and circumstances. As a general matter, I think the answer is no. Graham: Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that much closer to a conflict of interest? Rosenstein: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to answer a hypothetical, Senator. Everybody needs to make a determination based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. Graham: How would you get it before the Special Counsel? What process could a member of the Senate use to inform the Special Counsel that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a concern about hiring someone that represented Clinton? Rosenstein: We have a process within the Department of Justice, Senator, so I would encourage you, if you have those concerns, to raise them with [former] Director Mueller or to raise them with me, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make sure  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   Graham: So should I do it to you or to him?

            " b'ABUJA (Reuters) - A key community leader from Nigeria s tense Delta oil-producing region called on militants on Sunday not to resume their attacks until they had further time to negotiate their demands with the government.  Chief Edwin Clark, who leads the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), which has been holding peace talks with the government since last year, called on the Niger Delta Avengers militant group to  be patient.  The Avengers, whose attacks last year wrought havoc on the nation s oil output, promised on Friday a  brutish, brutal and bloody  return to violence because they said they had  lost faith  in local leaders to get what they wanted from the government.  This is not  the time to resume hostilities,  Clark said in a statement issued by the Presidential Amnesty Programme.  It is true that the federal government has not been quite serious about the negotiations, but we are asking the Niger Delta Avengers to maintain the peace.   He added that PANDEF was sending a delegation to meet the group s leaders.  The Avengers, like many in the Niger Delta, say they want a greater share of Nigeria s energy wealth to stay in the impoverished swampland region, which produces the bulk of the oil but is largely underdeveloped.  The statement came after a government delegation led by Brigadier General Paul Boroh, special adviser to the president on the Niger Delta, visited Clark at his Abuja home on Sunday. Clark said Boroh assured him that the talks were  back on track , and that PANDEF leaders would meet soon in Warri. The 2016 attacks slashed oil output to close to 1 million barrels per day from roughly 2.2 million bpd. That along with low oil prices pushed the nation into its first recession in 25 years.  '\n",

            " b'Carl Paladino s racism against President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama is so bad that his own son just publicly denounced him.Last week, Paladino, who served as a Trump campaign official, wrote a wish list full of hate against the Obamas. Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford,  Paladino wrote. [Obama] dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret, who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her,  he continued.Of Michelle Obama, he said:  I d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla. The racist outburst caused much outrage , and even Paladino s own son could no longer sit silent.Ellicott Development Company CEO William Paladino released a statement condemning his father on Christmas Eve. Ellicott Development takes pride in being a culturally diverse company with over 535 hard-working dedicated employees. We value and respect our employees, friends, partners and all of our commercial and residential tenancies and we do not condone the statements made about the President of the United States and his wife. They were disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary. However, many people pointed out in the comments that Carl Paladino is still the Chairman of the Board at Ellicott and that it s not enough to condemn his remarks if he is still allowed to hold onto his position. Therefore, a boycott has been called for against Ellicott and any business, government, and bank connected to them.Carl Paladino doesn t appear to be bothered by the condemnation either, suggesting that his son is only publicly breaking with him while privately supporting him. There is no reason for the company and its 550 employees to suffer from my politic, especially with the hate spewed by the activists who are devoid of any understanding of our history, our government and our constitution,  the elder Paladino wrote in an email to the New York Post.What Carl Paladino said about the Obama family is disgusting and he should be expelled from any remaining position he has with Ellicott and a stronger condemnation needs to be released from the company. But let s all remember that Carl Paladino worked for Donald Trump s campaign, which means Trump condoned Paladino s racism. That s not surprising, of course, considering Trump pandered to white supremacists throughout his campaign and has some working in his new administration.Featured Image: Screenshot'\n",

            " b'In what is seriously turning into a bromance for the ages, Donald Trump is now apparently turning into New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie s sugar daddy. Instead of a regular old campaign appearance like he s been doing across the nation, at one rally stop in New Jersey at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory Trump will be charging $200 per person to raise money for Christie s debt from his failed presidential campaign.If that sounds weird, it s because it is. Trump is now doing pretty substantial favors for Christie and it definitely makes one wonder what s up.Political science professor Brigid Harrison from Montclair State University said: This is really unique in its character. This is akin to Hillary Clinton holding a rally to pay off Bernie Sanders  debt, or to Barack Obama holding a rally to pay off Hillary Clinton s debt in 2008. And while it wouldn t be unusual if Trump had thrown a fundraiser for the explicit purpose of helping out Christie, doing so with a rally is found to be very odd by experts.And according to NJ.com: Trump will also appear at a second, private fundraiser Thursday for New Jersey s Republican Party, which still has $525,000 in debt related to legal bills from the George Washington Bridge scandal that engulfed Christie s administration. Tickets for that event: $25,000. Looks as though Trump is really starting to embrace the Republican party and now realizes the need for donations and contributors. All this while he still claims to be an outsider, but looks to be squirming his way into the infamous  establishment  likely noting it s in his best benefit moving forward towards November. He s a businessman and likely sees all of this as some form of deal, because it is. It also makes one wonder what role Christie would have within a Trump administration, because it s becoming more and more obvious that may be the course of action.Who knows, really? And hopefully we ll never have to find out.Featured Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images'\n",
            " b'The news reads like something out of a screwball comedy: a   activist named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReality Leigh Winner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d somehow received clearance to work for the National Security Agency, which she allegedly proceeded to rob of classified material in the name of the kookburger   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResistance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d In the   Snowden era, how does someone like this get anywhere near sensitive data? [Speaking of Snowden, Ms. Winner is a huge fan of his. He was one of only 50 accounts she followed on Twitter, along with WikiLeaks, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif, and the Anonymous hacker collective. Her own Twitter posts were filled with       tirades such as, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy burn a flag? Donald Trump thinks crosses burn much better. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d  She was also a supporter of climate change hysteria and the Black Lives Matter radical movement. Her last Tweet, from February, was advice for rapper Kanye West to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmake a shirt that says, \\xe2\\x80\\x98being white is terrorism. \\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just follow the Iranian Foreign Minister, she tweeted at him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are many Americans protesting U. S. government aggression towards Iran. If our Tangerine in Chief declares war, we stand with you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she gushed to Zarif. She also referred to President Trump as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe orange fascist we let into the White House,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and some other names that cannot be reprinted at a   website without exceeding our allotment of asterisks for the day. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn a positive note, this Tuesday when we become the United States of the Russian Federation, Olympic lifting will be the national sport,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she sneered in advance of the 2016 election. The totality of the Reality Winner experience reads like a joke put together for a presentation by bored NSA staffers about the sort of person that should never, ever be given a security clearance. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as though a   blog downloaded itself into a human brain and chose a name by reading its own comments section.  It should also be noted that the circumstances of this Iran fangirl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data theft are a blistering indictment of agency procedures. Even with a valid top secret clearance, Winner had no legitimate reason to see the documents she allegedly purloined. She was only caught because the website she reportedly leaked to contacted the NSA to ask if her material was legitimate. The agency that was stunned by how much sensitive material Edward Snowden managed to abscond with still doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to be properly compartmentalizing information and enforcing    rules. Fans of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeep State\\xe2\\x80\\x9d keep saying Trump made a big mistake picking a fight with them, but if the adventures of Reality Winner are an indication of the Deep State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skill and discipline, Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much to worry about. Also, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth repeating that nobody voted to give the Deep Staters or Reality Winners control over America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security, law enforcement, and foreign policy. Some hay has been made over Winner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nearly enough reason to question someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security clearance by itself. It is, however, fair to ask when the media will get around to asking Sanders if he disavows his treacherous supporter  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   as the press would certainly be doing if a   MAGAphile supporter of Donald Trump, boasting a Twitter feed full of   causes and celebrities, had looted the NSA to help a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresistance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d movement take down President Hillary Clinton.  In the alternate universe where that happened, you may rest assured the media freakout about Trump saboteurs threatening the very fabric of democracy has pushed all other stories off the front page today, and the upcoming Sunday talk shows are already booked solid. Of course, as we all know, Democrat politicians are firewalled from the misdeeds of their followers, and no   Climates of Hate are ever detected. Certain Democrats have no compunctions about actually encouraging criminality, secure in the knowledge their party will never be made to pay a price for going off the rails: Now more than ever we need whistleblowers to come forward. I created an official website on how to leak to the press https:  .   \\xe2\\x80\\x94   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) May 17, 2017,  Remember the Democrat   about President Trump supposedly compromising American secrets by warning the Russians about a terrorist plot? Some of them don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually seem all that concerned about real leaks of sensitive information, as long as it furthers their political goals.  Democrats have created an        environment that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guaranteed to drive their more   supporters around the bend. If one believes, as Reality Winner evidently does, that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president who must be resisted by any means necessary, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not difficult to justify lawbreaking or even deliberately damaging America, for the greater good of shoving that   usurper out of the White House.  Our security services absolutely must take this into account when granting clearances and sweeping sensitive departments for risky personnel. No one with Reality Winner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political beliefs can be trusted with anything sensitive, period.  Democrats created the environment in which   cannot be trusted in sensitive posts, not Donald Trump. Leftists and extreme NeverTrumpers excuse every offense against this administration by saying Trump brought it on himself, just by being himself. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not how the rule of law works.

            " b'RIO DE JANEIRO  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   The very idea of a medal count might seem contrary to the spirit of the Olympics, which are supposed to bring the world together for a couple of weeks and suspend the nationalism that keeps us apart. Yet keeping score is the essence of sport. And measured by the haul of gold, silver and bronze, the United States had an extraordinary Olympics in Rio, winning 121 medals, the most by an American team in a Summer Games free of boycotts. The size and depth of the United States team resulted in the most gold (46) silver (37) and bronze (38) medals of any nation. Only five countries have topped each medal category at the same Games. The Americans were the first to do it in 40 years, enabled in part by the barring of nearly a third of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team after revelations of   doping. (Another reliable powerhouse, China, underperformed.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis has been an incredible Games for Team U. S. A. by any measure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Alan Ashley, the chief of sport performance for the United States Olympic Committee, said Sunday at a news conference. Most striking was the performance by the American women. The American men won 18 gold medals, the same as Britain. But the American women were dominant with 27 (not including a gold in mixed doubles tennis). Had the women competed as a separate country, they would have ranked third in the overall medal chart (61) behind China (70) and Britain (67) and just ahead of the American men (60). There are two primary reasons for this  . The United States is one of the few countries to embed sports within the public education system. And equal access to sports for women comes with legal protections, gained with the education amendment known as Title IX in 1972 and the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act in 1978. About one of every two American girls participates in sports in high school. Of the 213 American medalists in individual and team sports in Rio, according to the U. S. O. C. nearly 85 percent participated in   sports. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose things don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist elsewhere in the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Donna Lopiano, a former executive director of the Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sports Foundation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have the largest base of athletic development. Our women are going to dominate, not only because of their legal rights but because women in other parts of the world are discriminated against. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d In the United States, more women than men watch the Summer Olympics on television. Girls see role models to emulate, and success perpetuates success. The champion performances by three   athletes  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   Simone Biles, who won four gold medals in gymnastics Simone Manuel, the first black woman to win Olympic gold in an individual swimming event and Ashleigh Johnson, the goalie for the    women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water polo team  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   are certain to broaden participation in sports that have historically been white. Ibtihaj Muhammad, who won a bronze medal in saber team fencing, became the first Olympic athlete to compete for the United States while wearing a hijab. And it was a women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team, in the   medley relay in swimming, that won the 1, 000th gold medal for the Americans since the modern Games began, in 1896. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou get on a roll,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGirls are looking and saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Wow, I can do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 whereas 30 years ago, not so many American girls thought that. It builds and builds. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d A country of 320 million, the United States ranked only 43rd in medals per capita, well behind small countries that won multiple medals, like Jamaica, New Zealand, Denmark, Croatia, Azerbaijan and Hungary, according to medalspercapita. com.   of the medals won by the United States, more than half of its total, came in swimming and track and field, the two sports offering the most chances to win medals. It also surely helped that American athletes competed in a time zone only one hour ahead of Eastern Daylight Time and did not have to risk jet lag by traveling to an Olympics in Europe or Asia. And some American success can be attributed to underperformance by other nations. Because of the doping controversy, Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entire weight lifting team was barred, and so was all but one athlete on its track and field team. Australia won its fewest Olympic medals (29) since the 1992 Barcelona Games. With 70 medals, China finished second over all, but that was 30 fewer than it won at the 2008 Beijing Games. This fits a pattern of host countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ebbing two Olympics later, Wallechinsky said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have seven years to prepare for an Olympics, everybody gets pumped up, you put money into different sports, you do well at home, and you develop a bunch of role models,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wallechinsky said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily carry over twice. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a consistent pattern of the host doing well, then pretty well at the next Olympics, then back to normal. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brazil won 19 medals, its highest total ever, but not as many as recent host nations like Britain (65) in 2012, China (100) in 2008 and Australia (58) in 2000. Home teams generally receive increased financial support in preparation for a Summer Olympics, but Brazil lacks an organized funding system for sports, and the Rio Games arrived with the country in an economic and political crisis. Still, Brazil won the gold medal it prized most  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   its first in men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soccer. More ambitious drug testing may have also affected the makeup of the Chinese team and others in Rio, Wallechinsky said. Several experts said that although enhanced international antidoping measures are far from perfect and have ensnared Americans, they might have particularly aided the success of the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 track and field team in Rio, as enhanced funding and training camps supported by shoe companies and U. S. A. Track  Field did. Michelle Carter became the first American woman to win the Olympic  . And the United States, long a sprint power, won medals in   and   running from 800 meters to the marathon, highlighted by Matt Centrowitz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory at 1, 500 meters, the metric mile. He was the first American to win the event since 1908. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA level playing field benefits all athletes and helps our medal chances,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jill Geer, a spokeswoman for U. S. A. Track  Field. The ruthless nature of selecting a team at the Olympic trials, instead of by past performances, also appeared to be an important factor, Centrowitz said. Brianna Rollins, Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin of the United States swept the   hurdles in Rio while the   holder, an American named Kendra Harrison, did not make the team. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the three fastest people on paper it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best three people on a given day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Centrowitz said, describing team selection per event at the Olympic trials. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you had to do here, perform on that specific day. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",
            " b'On Sunday, Scottie Nell Hughes joined a panel discussion on CNN s Reliable Sources where the Trump campaign surrogate defended Donald Trump s characterization of his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton as a  bigot.  The justification for the label? Clinton is prejudiced against the racist faction of Trump s base.Most of the conversation surrounded the Trump campaigns hiring of Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO. Bannon is officially on a  temporary leave  from his position as the executive chairman for the reactionary (often dubbed as the  alt-right ) right-wing media site, Breitbart. The site caters to an audience that would probably consider Fox News to be a liberal propaganda network.MTV News host, Jamil Smith said during the panel discussion that he considers Breitbart to support white supremacy and racism. I would say that [Breitbart is] part of the white supremacist machine. They are trying to make sure these views become mainstream. And I think, through Trump, they are finding a way to do that. Trump has faced waves of criticism for the move to hire Bannon from Clinton, the left, and even some members of the right. To which Trump referred to Clinton as a bigot for doing so. Here s Hughes justification for the use of the term: Bigotry, if you look at the definition, it s about someone who s small-minded and sits there and directs hate towards a certain group. Hillary Clinton s speech was all about hate towards a group that, while my fellow counterpart might consider them to be very racist, it s the exact opposite. At that point, Hughes dives hot-head first into one of her just this side of unhinged rants, claiming that just because a section of Breitbart s readers are white supremacists, doesn t mean they all are.Smith, apparently noticing that Hughes doesn t understand what he said at all clarifies his position: What they present is the view of the white supremacist mentality through their coverage. It s not necessarily saying,  Well, everyone who works there is a white supremacist.  I don t know that.  Smith continues, finalizing his thoughts,  The point is to say, what kind of viewpoint did they reflect? And it s undeniable that they reflect a white supremacist view if you looked over their coverage over the last several years. I would consider being called a bigot against white supremacists and those who promote it a badge of honor, as I m sure most people would. In the mind of a Trump campaign surrogate, that s a valid line of attack.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot'\n",
            " b'Wow! A Chinese artist decided it would be a great idea to exploit the refugees by having pillars decorated with the lifejackets used by them. This nut job flew in thousands of life jackets for this obscene display. You have to wonder what this guy was thinking when he had all guests at the charity event don emergency blankets. Yes, that s Charlize Theron taking a selfie with her gold blanket on.  Unreal! The liberal elites don t get how horrible this has been for all of Europe and for those who ve died trying to get to the shores of Greece. A film charity event held alongside an installation in Berlin by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has sparked anger.According to Artnet, the Cinema for Peace fundraiser took place at the Berlin Konzerthaus, whose pillars the artist decorated   as part of his installation Safe Passage   with 14,000 lifejackets flown in from Lesbos, Greece, where almost 450,000 refugees arrived in 2015 on their way into the EU:Fundraiser guests, including actor Charlize Theron and Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova, were encouraged to don emergency thermal blankets similar to those given to refugees.In a Facebook post, Tim Renner, Berlin s culture secretary, was highly critical of the sight of dinner guests at a star-studded gala posing in the blankets at the party.There are better ways for Ai Weiwei to take a political stand than posing as a drowned infant When Ai Weiwei illustrates the dimensions of terror outside [the gala] with 14,000 life jackets from Lesbos, it is perhaps not subtle but effective and justified; but when the guests of Cinema for Peace are prompted by the organiser to don emergency blankets for a group photo, even if understood as an act of solidarity, it has a clearly obscene element,  he said.Ai Weiwei, whose recent work has focused on the migration crisis, was criticised two weeks ago for recreating a photo of the drowned Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi   for the magazine India Today   in which the artist lies face down on a beach. He maintained that his work was intended to  defend the dignity  of the refugees.Via: The Guardian'\n",

            " b'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supporters of former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday expressed anger and vindication over leaked comments made by Hillary Clinton to banks and big business that appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to Wall Street. Clinton, who needs Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 coalition of young and left-leaning voters to propel her to the presidency, pushes for open trade and open borders in one of the speeches, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from in an effort to capture the popular appeal of Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attacks on trade deals and powerful banks.  The excerpts of remarks by the former secretary of state, made in 2013 and 2014 in closed-door meetings where audiences paid to attend, were published online on Friday by WikiLeaks, which sourced them to the email account of John Podesta, Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign chairman.  Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the speech transcripts. Clinton has previously declined to release any such transcripts. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a very clear illustration of why there is a fundamental lack of trust from progressives for Hillary Clinton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tobita Chow, chair of the People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lobby in Chicago, which endorsed Sanders in the primary election. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe progressive movement needs to make a call to Secretary Clinton to clarify where she stands really on these issues and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to involve very clear renunciations of the positions that are revealed in these transcripts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chow said. The revelations were quickly overshadowed by the release of an 11-year-old recording of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, making lewd comments about women.  Clinton has worked hard to build trust with so-called progressives, adopting several of Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 positions after she bested him in the primary race. The U.S. senator from Vermont now supports his former rival in the Nov. 8 general election against Trump. Still, Clinton has struggled to win support from young \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmillennials\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who were crucial to Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 success, and some Democrats expressed concern that the leaks would discourage those supporters from showing up to vote.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a big concern and this certainly doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Larry Cohen, chair of the board of Our Revolution, a progressive organization formed in the wake of Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bid for the presidency, which aims to keep pushing the former candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas at a grassroots level. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt matters in terms of turnout, energy, volunteering, all those things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Clinton campaign said it would not confirm the accuracy of the documents released by WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange, who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Glen Caplin, a campaign spokesman.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, referring to the hacker or hacking group that altered some data stolen from the Democratic National Committee before making it public earlier this year.  The U.S. government on Friday formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the election. The origin of the leaks did not dampen social media criticism of the speeches by some. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBernie was right about Hillary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote Facebook user Grace Tilly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tool for Wall Street.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClinton is the politicians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 politician - exactly the Wall Street insider Bernie described,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote Facebook user Brian Leach. Spokesmen for Sanders did not respond to requests for comment. NBC News quoted a statement from Sanders saying he would work to advance the Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 policy platform. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic Party platform which was agreed to by her campaign,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the statement said. Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said progressive voters would still choose the former first lady, even with misgivings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to meet the Bernie Sanders supporter who is going to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Well I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little worried about her on international trade, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to vote for Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.

            " b'Over the course of five days, Tulsa deputies watched 37-year-old Elliot Williams slowly die on the floor of his cell.According to court documents filed in Oklahoma District Court, in October 2011, Williams was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of resisting an officer. A U.S. military veteran, his family reports that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder while serving in the military.On the night he was arrested, Williams  family had taken him to a hotel in Owasso, OK, because he was having marital problems and experiencing symptoms of mental illness. His family states that he had not slept in days and was threatening to kill himself. While at the hotel, Williams reportedly caused a disturbance, resulting in Owasso police being called to the scene.Once police arrived, Williams failed to comply with the officers  orders, threatening to kill himself. Instead of waiting for mental health professionals, deputies pepper-sprayed him and placed him under arrest.Once he was in police custody, court documents show that Williams began to slip further into his mental illness. He stripped himself of his clothing, crawled under a bench and began barking like a dog. The Frontier reports that he was transferred from the Owasso jail to the Tulsa jail, after these events.In spite of repeated threats of suicide, Williams was never placed on suicide watch. Instead, he was placed in a regular holding cell. Less than an hour later he rammed his own head into a steel door. He fell to the floor and began crying out for help, telling jail staff that he couldn t move and that he had broken his neck.Over the course of the next ten hours, Williams remained motionless on the floor of the holding cell. He received no medical attention during this time. The Frontier reports that multiple staff, including jail supervisors, were aware of Williams  condition.The following morning Williams was visited by the jail nurse. Instead of providing medical attention, the nurse cussed at and berated Williams, telling him that he should be  ashamed  of himself, to get his  nasty ass  in the shower, and to  quit fucking faking. A short time later, two officers placed the paralyzed man on a gurney. According to court documents, they then dumped Mr. Williams off the gurney into the shower where Williams hit his head with a  smack.  Williams was left in the shower for three hours, unable to move.Over the next three days, multiple members of the jail staff expressed concern about Williams  condition. No one called for outside help or provided him with adequate medical treatment. During this time, a detention officer had to  pour water into his mouth  and feed him by holding his head up.An LPN, Raymond Stiles, reportedly checked on Williams during this time. It is not clear what kind of treatment or examination Stiles provided to the paralyzed man, but in a  progress note,  written after the visit, the nurse wrote Wants to be waited on. On October 24, Williams was also briefly visited by John Bell, a member of the jail s mental health staff. Williams told Bell he was paralyzed and told him  I want water.  Bell s notes state that he provided Williams with  coping skills education. On October 25, Williams was seen for 12 minutes by Dr. Stephen Harnish, the jail psychiatrist. Again he repeated his claim that he had broken his neck and could not move. Harnish also ignored his condition. As noted in the court records: Instead of providing or ordering medical care, Harnish ordered jail staff to place Mr. Williams in Medical Cell number 1, which would be his burial crypt.   The remainder of Williams  life was recorded by a video camera. Watch the video below, courtesy of The Frontier.On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge John Dowdell ruled that a lawsuit filed by Williams  family could proceed.In his ruling, Dowdell stated: A reasonable jury could find that Mr. Williams  needs were obvious to any layperson. They could also find that the medical unit-wide attitude of inhumanity and indifference shown to him, which resulted in the delay and denial of medical care in the face of his symptoms that were obviously indicative of a serious medical condition or medical emergency, amounted to deliberate indifference.

            " b'(Reuters) - U.S. judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. However, lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on Sunday to follow the judges\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rulings. Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Brooklyn borough. Donnelly had ruled in a lawsuit by two men from Iraq being held at John F. Kennedy International Airport. While none of the rulings struck down Friday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive order by the new Republican president, the growing number of them could complicate the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effort to enforce it. The rulings add to questions about the constitutionality of the order, said Andrew Pincus, a Mayer Brown partner representing two Yemeni men who were denied U.S. entry from an overseas flight despite being legal permanent residents. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople have gone through processes to obtain legal permanent resident status, or visas,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pincus said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are serious questions about whether those rights, which were created by statute, can be unilaterally taken away without process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. He said these actions were needed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The order sparked a global backlash, including from U.S. allies that view the actions as discriminatory and divisive. Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, in a statement condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdangerous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunconstitutional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d order. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Sunday said it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill comply with judicial orders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while enforcing Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order in a manner that ensures those entering the United States \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo not pose a threat to our country or the American people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Striking that balance has caused confusion, according to lawyers who worked overnight and on Sunday to help travelers at JFK Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia, and elsewhere. Immigration lawyer Sharifa Abbasi said some Border Patrol agents at Dulles refused to let lawyers talk with detainees, even after being shown an order from U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema requiring such access. Abbasi said the agents instead told the lawyers to call their agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, where no one was answering. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is really no method to this madness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Becca Heller, director of the\\xc2\\xa0New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project organization, told reporters on a conference call. Supporters of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order said authorities acted properly in swiftly taking steps to enforce it.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is better (to) be safe than sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the conservative Center for\\xc2\\xa0Immigration Studies in Washington. Lawsuits on behalf of more than 100 individual travelers have been filed nationwide, activists and lawyers estimated. Some have come from large corporate firms including Mayer Brown, Kirkland & Ellis, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Sunday temporarily blocked the removal of two Iranians who have taught at the University of Massachusetts, and had been detained at the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Logan International Airport. Burroughs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ruling appeared to go further than Donnelly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s by barring the detention, as well as the removal, of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents entering from the seven countries. Donnelly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order forbade only removal. Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, in a statement called Burroughs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ruling \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca huge victory for justice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the face of what he called Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunconstitutional ban on Muslims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The U.S. Constitution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order sought to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, which the president said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. Burroughs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ruling also prompted some Trump critics to urge holders of green cards, which allow foreign nationals to live and work permanently in the United States, to fly into Boston, to lessen the risk of detainment. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said several times on NBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeet the Press\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order does not affect green card holders \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoving forward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In a ruling on Sunday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles directed the return to the United States of Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan, who authorities had sent back to his native Iran following Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order.  The ruling from Brinkema, in Alexandria, Virginia, barred the Homeland Security agency from removing an estimated 50 to 60 legal permanent residents who had been detained at Dulles. In Seattle, U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly barred the government from removing two people, who were not named in court papers. He scheduled a Feb. 3 hearing on whether to lift that stay. '\n",
            " b'How Hillary Clinton Locked Up The Democratic Nomination In 10 Steps\\n\\nThe primary season isn\\'t quite wrapped yet (six states hold Democratic contests Tuesday), but Hillary Clinton has now secured the number of delegates needed (2,383) to become the Democratic Party\\'s presumptive nominee.\\n\\nSpeaking Monday night, Clinton said, \"according to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment. But we still have work to do, don\\'t we?\"\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t easy for Clinton to emerge from this campaign season victorious \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she got there by applying lessons from her failed 2008 bid and forming strong alliances with Democrats, President Obama and voters of color. And by surviving an epic 11-hour congressional hearing.\\n\\nHere\\'s a look back at the Democratic primary and 10 steps Clinton took to climb to the nomination:\\n\\nOn June 7, 2008, four days after the final votes were cast in the lengthy and contentious Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton gave quite possibly the best political speech of her career. She was bowing out of the race, conceding what news organizations had already called. Barack Obama had won more pledged delegates and had more so-called superdelegates lined up behind him. He was going to be the party\\'s nominee.\\n\\nDepending on how you counted, Clinton had won the popular vote and could have taken the fight all the way to the convention. But instead, she brought her supporters together at the Building Museum in Washington, D.C., to mourn what could have been and look ahead. Gone (at least visibly) was the bitterness of the campaign, replaced with a message about all they had accomplished.\\n\\n\"Although we weren\\'t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you it\\'s got about 18 million cracks in it,\" Clinton said to the roaring crowd. \"And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.\"\\n\\nAnd seemingly, it has been a little easier for her this time. Clinton appears more comfortable nodding to her chance at making history than she was in 2008, usually with a joke about her hair or as a rebuttal to the idea that she\\'s too establishment. Her supporters frequently talk about it, saying things like \"it\\'s time.\" In dozens of interviews with Clinton backers, excitement about having a woman make it to the White House is almost always preceded or followed by mention of Clinton as the \"most qualified\" or \"experienced\" candidate in the race. And whatever you do, don\\'t suggest they\\'re just voting for her because she\\'s a woman.\\n\\nSo-called superdelegates are a pretty good stand-in for the Democratic Party establishment. They are elected officials and party leaders, and they overwhelmingly support Hillary Clinton. Back in November, when NPR first looked at the declared allegiances of these superdelegates, Clinton had a 45 to 1 advantage over her most serious opponent, Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nClinton had the endorsement of all but one Democratic woman in the Senate, and Sanders won the endorsement of only one of his Senate colleagues, Jeff Merkley. Endorsements don\\'t necessarily sway voters, but they do indicate institutional support and in this case a coalescing behind a single candidate.\\n\\nClinton\\'s shadow loomed large over the Democratic field \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so large that many big names in the party didn\\'t even think about running in 2016. Elizabeth Warren didn\\'t run. Joe Biden stayed out (though the death of his son likely had more to do with that than concern about taking on Clinton). The nation\\'s most popular sitting Democratic governors sat out, too (Maryland\\'s recently former Gov. Martin O\\'Malley did run, but his campaign never took off). That meant Clinton\\'s biggest competition was a 74-year-old independent senator from Vermont who described himself as a Democratic socialist.\\n\\nThe Democratic National Committee and its chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, have never admitted it, but many looked at the Democratic debate schedule and saw an advantage for Clinton. There were initially only a handful of debates scheduled, and the first one wasn\\'t until October, meaning lesser-known candidates like O\\'Malley and Sanders weren\\'t able to get a nationally televised audience for their message until a big part of the campaign (and even some voter registration deadlines) had passed.\\n\\nSanders was able to draw huge crowds, raise massive sums of money and win an impressive number of states. But the Democratic Party establishment never wavered in its support of Clinton.\\n\\nThere was no love lost between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during the primary in 2008. But when it was over, Clinton endorsed her opponent and even called for the end of the roll call vote at the convention, moving that Obama win the nomination by acclamation. She worked hard to make sure that her supporters, even those known as PUMAs (\"party unity my a**\"), came around to supporting Obama.\\n\\nShe and her husband, Bill, campaigned tirelessly for Obama through the fall. And then, when Obama asked, she agreed to join the Obama administration as secretary of state. She then worked tirelessly in that position, traveling to more than 100 countries promoting Obama\\'s agenda.\\n\\nWhy does this matter? Because her loyalty didn\\'t go unnoticed by voters who supported and continue to support Obama.\\n\\n\"She was a fighter, but she knew when to let go,\" said Paulette Roca, who saw Clinton speak at the National Action Network convention, organized by civil rights activist Al Sharpton. \"And now? She\\'s going to be OK now. She has respect. When black women respect you, you\\'ve got respect\" (see No. 4 for more on this).\\n\\nIn the primary, Clinton was able to ride Obama\\'s coattails, while at times (Wall Street regulation, campaign cash) using him as a human shield against attacks from Sanders.\\n\\nBlack women love Hillary Clinton. At least that\\'s what exit polls from state after state will tell you. In Alabama, 93 percent of black women voted for her. In Virginia, it was 85 percent. And this is no small thing because in 2008 and 2012, African-American women were the most reliable Democratic voters. This support was a critical part of Clinton\\'s firewall against Sanders in the early voting states of Nevada and South Carolina, and made a big difference for her in the March 1 Super Tuesday states and beyond.\\n\\nHow did Clinton earn such overwhelming support? Years and years of relationships. One of Clinton\\'s first jobs was working with Marian Wright Edelman at the Children\\'s Defense Fund. And in more recent years, she has quietly reached out to the mothers of young African-Americans killed in gun violence or encounters with police.\\n\\n\"When you\\'re openly grieving and the secretary of state steps to you, you\\'d better endorse her, because she\\'s already endorsed you,\" said Geneva Reed-Veal, the mother of Sandra Bland, a woman who died in her jail cell last year. Reed-Veal and other \"mothers of the movement\" were campaigning for Clinton.\\n\\nClinton had no surrogates more powerful than those mothers.\\n\\nIn 2008, Clinton was the candidate with town halls that were too big, infighting advisers, and an operation that didn\\'t get into the nitty-gritty details of delegates and missed the political phenomenon about to overtake her. In 2016, Clinton\\'s campaign purposely kept the events small and emphasized listening. She hired a no-drama campaign manager and brought on Obama\\'s polling and delegate gurus. The campaign\\'s mantra has been, \"We\\'re working for every vote and taking nothing for granted.\" Even if no one believed them at first, the 2016 Clinton campaign has always operated like it was expecting a tough primary (it got one from Sanders) and a challenging general election fight, too.\\n\\nCompared with Sanders\\' big rallies, her small town halls and coffee chats have seemed puny and low on energy. But for those who attend, there\\'s a real connection.\\n\\n\"I think she works the room like this like nobody can,\" said Adrienne Press, a supporter who attended a small Clinton rally in Manhattan. Afterward, Clinton worked the rope line for a long time, shaking hands and taking selfies. \"You see the real Hillary in this situation, and that fires people up. It fires me up.\"\\n\\nThe campaign has played to Clinton\\'s strengths (her wonk flag flies at town hall-style events) and emphasized winning the most delegates possible in every contest, helping her build up a massive lead Sanders was never able to substantially dent.\\n\\nClinton and her team knew from the start that economic populism was running strong through the Democratic electorate. In the very first remarks of her campaign, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court\\'s Citizens United decision on campaign finance, and she decried the growing separation between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top,\" Clinton said at a campaign stop in Iowa. \"And there\\'s something wrong with that.\"\\n\\nThis didn\\'t stop Sanders from getting into the race a month later. Now, more than a year later, she is pitching herself to Sanders supporters, saying their differences really aren\\'t all that great.\\n\\nClinton has a mountain of policy papers and more on the way. They cover everything from opioid addiction and mass incarceration to paid family leave and Alzheimer\\'s. If there\\'s an issue Clinton has heard about on the campaign trail, she likely has a plan to address it.\\n\\nIt\\'s something she says people mock her for (though it\\'s not clear who).\\n\\n\"Some people have commented like, \\'Enough with the plans, Hillary. We don\\'t want to hear anymore plans,\\' \" she said with a smile at a rally in April.\\n\\nBut she argued that the plans were a critical part of her campaign, of letting voters know what they are signing up for.\\n\\n\"It is easy to diagnose the problems facing America,\" she said to cheers. \"We need solutions that we work together to achieve.\"\\n\\nThis praise of plans may not sound all that inspiring, but spend a little time talking to Clinton supporters, and it seems like each one cites a different plan as something that really hits home for them and motivated them to volunteer for the campaign. All those plans also allowed Clinton to deliver her message to people in places where they wouldn\\'t necessarily find politics, like a Facebook group for families of children with autism.\\n\\nSanders had been gaining steam throughout the summer, but the campaign hit a wall in October 2015. That\\'s when Clinton turned in a strong debate performance and then a week later made it through an epic 11-hour hearing of the House special committee investigating the attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans including the ambassador to Libya. The Benghazi attack was one of the darkest moments of Clinton\\'s time as secretary of state and has been a weight on her ever since, through multiple congressional investigations and a raft of conspiracy theories about what really happened.\\n\\nThe hearing also focused on Clinton\\'s exclusive use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state. When the hearing was over, the reviews were nearly unanimous: Clinton had performed well under pressure, and the committee\\'s Republicans failed to find any smoking guns. The committee has still not released its investigative report and has largely been quiet since the hearing.\\n\\nIt was perhaps Sanders\\' most memorable line of the entire campaign. It came in the first Democratic debate of 2015, and it largely neutralized one of Clinton\\'s largest liabilities, at least for the primary.\\n\\n\"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,\" Sanders said to applause.\\n\\nClinton responded saying: \"Thank you. Me too, me too.\" She let out a big laugh.\\n\\nSanders\\' larger point that the emails were a distraction from the important issues facing Americans was lost. He had just seemingly let her off the hook.\\n\\nNow, the email issue is far from over. The inspector general for the State Department recently released a highly critical report saying Clinton hadn\\'t followed department protocol and that she and her team didn\\'t cooperate with his investigation. And the FBI has an ongoing investigation into her use of a private server for official business.\\n\\nBut, thanks in part to Sanders, Clinton\\'s email problem was more of a nuisance than a deal breaker in the Democratic primary.\\n\\nThere were the photo lines with volunteers before and after public events, the calls to superdelegates, the trips to states she had no chance of winning, with the hope of narrowing the margin and securing a few more delegates. That\\'s what Clinton did.\\n\\nHer campaign\\'s volunteers and staff held house parties, they knocked on doors in snowstorms (people are extra friendly then) and spent hours making phone calls.\\n\\nOrganizing isn\\'t glamorous. It\\'s the grunt work of campaigning. But her campaign credits that hard work with her narrowest-of-margins win in the Iowa caucuses. The demographics of the state favored Sanders, but she was able to pull out a win. Barely.\\n\\nIn short, Hillary Clinton and her campaign never took it easy.'\n",
            " b'Rick Scott has been governor of Florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism. While the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of HIV and the number of people dying from AIDS drops, Florida is seeing the reverse.In a comprehensive review of how Scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding, the Miami Herald discovered two disturbing facts: Florida now leads the nation in HIV cases, and its biggest county, Miami-Dade, is ground zero.New cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. Miami-Dade and Broward together account for 38 percent of that total.Although Florida is among the nation s fastest-growing states, Scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the Department of Health.The 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions compared to 12,759 in the year Scott took office. It s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,  said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.  We have a rise in AIDS and we have a reduction in public health spending. We re now cutting just to be cutting. Indeed, Scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers. He s a tax-cutting superstar in the same vein as Kansas Governor Sam Brownback (who imploded his state s economy) and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (whose neglect poisoned an entire city).However, he differs from his fellow conservative tax-slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had. At least Brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth. In a disturbing reminder of the Reagan era, when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the AIDS epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy, Scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in HIV cases. Or perhaps he s just grown used to it. After his first year in office, the number of HIV cases has grown hand-over-fist.Making matters worse, Scott has routinely fought against working with Obamacare in his state. For years. All the while, HIV cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold. This spells disasters for the victims of HIV because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier AIDS illness is careful health management. You can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the President.As we ve seen around the country, Republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it. Far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self-determination, states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate.  It s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad,  but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it.Florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful.  Oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr'\n",
            " b'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Branding Donald Trump a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdangerous demagogue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d USA Today on Thursday urged its readers not to vote for the Republican presidential candidate, but added that it was not endorsing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton either. The national newspaper said in an editorial that it had never taken sides in U.S. presidential elections in its 34-year history, but was abandoning the practice because the New York real estate developer was unfit for the presidency. It went on to list and expand on eight reasons for its stance, including: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is ill-equipped to be commander in chief,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe traffics in prejudice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a serial liar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the editorial said.

I know he is ready to lead the United States as our next president and commander in chief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump and Clinton are locked in a close race for the Nov. 8 election. A majority of Americans say Clinton won their first presidential debate on Monday, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll. USA Today, published by Gannett Co Inc, said its editorial board was divided on Clinton, and some of the reservations about the former secretary of state centered on her \\xe2\\x80\\x9csense of entitlement, her lack of candor and her extreme carelessness in handling classified information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Urging voters to stay true to their convictions, USA Today said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever you do, however, resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue.

            " b'Fox News is literally pretending that they treated President Obama with nothing but respect.The reality, however, is the complete opposite as Fox News and Republicans spent eight years calling President Obama an illegitimate president and working against him to make him fail.They rejected President Obama s call for unity from the very beginning, questioned his citizenship, obstructed, demonized, and whined.Fox News served as the Republican s anti-Obama propaganda machine for all eight years.But now that Donald Trump is being given the same treatment across the country, Fox News is throwing a hissy fit about it.They expect everyone across the country to bow down and kiss Trump s ass and anyone who doesn t do so is branded as a traitor or un-American.It s hypocrisy of the highest order.That s why the Huffington Post put together a wonderful little video showcasing Fox News hosts flip-flopping repeatedly. It s the kind of thing that Jon Stewart would have done if he had never retired from the Daily Show.The video shows hosts like Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, and Bill O Reilly complaining about anti-Trump protesters complete with flashbacks of all three being vehemently anti-Obama. Hannity even uses the term  not my president  to express his hatred of Obama.Here s the video via Huffington Post.Fox News is full of hypocrites. They are whining about the anti-Trump movement and ignoring the fact that conservatives did even worse to President Obama over eight years.When President Obama extended his hand Fox News slapped it away and denounced him as illegitimate. They pushed conspiracy theories. They called him a tyrant. They allied with Republicans to make President Obama fail and proceeded to try and sabotage him at every turn. They created an atmosphere of hate and ignorance that allowed Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters to rise. And now they have the gall to bitch about protests against that hatred.Donald Trump does not deserve the respect or unity he has only recently begun calling for. If anything, he deserves to be treated the same way conservatives treated President Obama for eight years. Fox and their conservative audience should have practiced then what they are preaching now, because turnabout is fair play and unlike Obama, Trump is a true threat to our democracy and Constitution.Featured image via screenshot'\n",
            " b'BALTIMORE  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   Nearly two years after the death of a black man in police custody led to violent riots here, the Justice Department and city leaders announced on Thursday a   agreement to impose greater oversight and training on a police force found to have routinely harassed minorities. Negotiators have been rushing for weeks to complete the deal before the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald J. Trump and the expected confirmation of his attorney general pick, Senator Jeff Sessions. Both men are seen as hostile to police oversight agreements like the one put in place on Thursday, with Mr. Trump denouncing what he called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwar on police\\xe2\\x80\\x9d during his presidential campaign. Justice Department negotiators are moving quickly to complete a second investigation in Chicago, which has also been wracked by violence and tension between the police and residents. The findings of that investigation could come as early as Friday. Announcing the Baltimore deal at City Hall, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said she was confident that the reforms mandated by the deal would take hold even if the Trump administration were to take steps to try to undo it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis agreement is binding and it will live on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Lynch, flanked by Mayor Catherine Pugh, Police Commissioner Kevin Davis, Vanita Gupta, the head of the civil rights division at the Justice Department, and others. Mr. Davis said the pact provides \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca path forward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that he said will benefit both his officers and the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents and that it should serve as a model for thousands of other police departments in tackling tensions. Baltimore came under Justice Department scrutiny after an   man, Freddie Gray, 25, died of a spinal cord injury he received while in police custody in 2015 as he was being transported in a department van. The death led to widespread protests  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, called in the National Guard to quell riots  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and appeals for federal intervention. In the ensuing political fallout, the Democratic mayor, Stephanie   dismissed the police chief and six officers were charged in Mr. Gray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death none were convicted. The episode roiled racial tensions nationwide amid a string of other deaths of black men in police confrontations nationwide, from Ferguson, Mo. to Staten Island. The Justice Department filed a   consent decree in federal court on Thursday just minutes before announcing the deal. A judge must approve it before the city and the Police Department begin putting in place more than a dozen changes, including improved training and technology, community oversight, and greater transparency in dealings between the police and the public. Once that is done, the crucial first step will almost surely fall to the Trump administration: working with the city to recommend an outside, independent monitor to determine whether Baltimore is adequately taking steps to address what a blistering Justice Department report in August found was systemic racial bias in its policing. Ms. Pugh, a Democrat who has been in office 33 days, recounted hectic, 1:30 a. m. phone calls with negotiators in the weeks leading up to the agreement. She called the results \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca great day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for Baltimore. She made clear what she considered the most important element: \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraining, training, training, training. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The agreement requires officers to go through 80 hours of training in practices like community policing and proper tactics for stops, searches and arrests. Another measure will require improved safety technology and video cameras inside police vans like the one used to transport Mr. Gray when he died. The Justice Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report on city policing last year found that officers routinely stopped large numbers of people in poor, black neighborhoods for dubious reasons, and arrested residents merely for speaking out in ways police officers deemed disrespectful. In Baltimore, a city that is 63 percent black, the report found that 91 percent of those arrested on discretionary offenses like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfailure to obey\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrespassing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were  . Blacks made up 60 percent of Baltimore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drivers but accounted for 82 percent of traffic stops. Of the 410 pedestrians who were stopped at least 10 times in the five and a half years of data reviewed, 95 percent were black. The findings also painted a picture of a police culture deeply dismissive of sexual assault victims and hostile toward prostitutes and transgender people. The decree\\xe2\\x80\\x99s requirements are intended to prohibit unlawful stops and arrests, and to prevent discriminatory policing and excessive force. Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, called the agreement \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca chance to   trust\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between residents and the police after a painful few years. DeRay Mckesson, a   voice in the Black Lives Matter movement who lives in Baltimore, said he was impressed by the decree\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wide range. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is the first consent decree that I have seen that addresses the Police Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internal affairs division,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Mckesson said by text message, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand goes further to ensure that officers are not targeting poor citizens or citizens in historically \\xe2\\x80\\x98 \\xe2\\x80\\x99 areas and addresses the response to citizens in crisis or with mental health challenges. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Provisions of the decree prohibit the police from stopping people based solely on where they are, or how they respond to the presence of a police officer. The Supreme Court has ruled that officers can stop a person who flees from them in   neighborhoods. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis starts to push back on that line and says, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Look, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really reinforcing that people have a right to avoid contact with the police and the place they live shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be an important factor in how much Fourth Amendment protection they get,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said David Jaros, an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut at the same time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jaros added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambiguous as to what its reach is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and whether it limits police actions further than existing law does. Tessa   the president of Baltimore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said she was heartened to see that the Police Department had already implemented reforms  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   like testing body cameras and changing aspects of prisoner transport  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and hoped the consent decree would bring more. But Tawanda Jones, the sister of Tyrone West, who died in 2013 after a struggle with the police, said the rush to finish the deal and the coming handover of power in Washington had eroded her faith that the decree would bring about meaningful change in Baltimore. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does a piece of paper mean? It means nothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Jones said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a training issue it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a system that is broke. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a system that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hold people accountable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",
            " b'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, on Friday told Fox News Channel that fellow Republican Representative Blake Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf these allegations are proven to be true ... I would hope that he would step aside,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican Conference. Farenthold\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office was not immediately available to comment on her remarks. The House Ethics Committee said on Thursday it was investigating Farenthold, 55, over allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. It said it was also looking into whether the Corpus Christi, Texas, congressman made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff. Farenthold said on Thursday he was relieved that the ethics panel was going to look into the accusations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce all the facts are released, I\\xe2\\x80\\x98m confident this matter will once and for all be settled and resolved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Politico reported last week that the congressional Office of Compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of Farenthold for a sexual harassment claim. In 2014, Farenthold\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former communications director Lauren Greene sued him, alleging a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and retaliation, court documents showed. Farenthold and Greene reached a mediated agreement in 2015 to avoid costly litigation, but the settlement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s details were confidential, according to a statement released at the time in which Farenthold denied engaging in any wrongdoing. A number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct. This week, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks resigned, while Democratic Senator Al Franken said he would be stepping down in the coming weeks. '\n",
            " b'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain s ruling Conservatives barred two of their own lawmakers in the European Parliament after they broke the party whip and voted for a motion demanding London do more to meet EU demands in Brexit talks.  Julie Girling and ... Richard Ashworth were suspended from the Conservative Party last night after supporting a resolution ... to block Brexit talks moving forward,  the party said on Sunday in a statement that highlighted divisions over Britain s move to quit the European Union in 18 months. Prime Minister Theresa May supported the move. A government source said the two had behaved  totally irresponsibly .      They left the party no choice but to act,  Ashley Fox, leader of the 20-strong group, said in the statement, describing the decision of Ashworth and Girling, a former group leader and chief whip respectively, as  extremely regrettable . Girling, who like Ashworth and Fox opposed Brexit during last year s referendum, defended her decision to vote with the overwhelming majority in Strasbourg on Tuesday on a non-binding resolution which urged EU leaders not to accept London s request for talks on post-Brexit trade without further concessions.  I did not vote to prevent trade talks,  she said, noting she called for such negotiations. However, she said in a statement that it was  patently obvious  that the EU s test of  sufficient progress  on key divorce issues were not yet met.  Her vote, she said, put the interests of her constituents over party discipline and referred to support on the far-right for Britain to walk out without a deal:  I have never agreed to silently acquiesce as our country heads towards a cliff edge,  she said, describing that as  wanton economic self-harm .  May, who also opposed Brexit, is battling to contain in-fighting over approaches to Brexit and threats to her leadership after an uncertain party conference performance last week. Her Brexit minister David Davis is due back in Brussels this week for further talks. The party statement said Davis had written to leaders of the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties to complain after most British MEPs voted with the majority. He urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to suspend most of his MEPs. '\n",
            " b'Four former top economists in Democratic administrations signed a letter taking Bernie Sanders\\'s campaign to task for touting a document by University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman that purports to show that Sanders\\'s policies would boost the American growth rate to more than 5 percent.\\n\\nAlan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, Christina Romer, and Laura D\\'Andrea Tyson all served at one time or another as chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers under either Barack Obama or Bill Clinton; their letter isn\\'t signed by three other CEA chairs from Clinton\\'s tenure: Janet Yellen (who\\'s busy running the Fed), Joseph Stiglitz (who\\'s well to the left of this group), and Martin Baily (who tells me he didn\\'t know anything about it).\\n\\nThe letter cites Friedman\\'s assumption that the economy would grow by 5.3 percent under Sanders, and comments, \"No credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes.\" Further, the economists argue that making this kind of claim undermines \"our party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic.\"\\n\\nSomewhat ironically, this group of empirically minded wonks doesn\\'t actually offer an empirical critique of the study they are worried about \\xe2\\x80\\x94 relying simply on their authority as Democratic Party luminaries to bat it down.\\n\\nThis controversy is, on one level, almost totally meaningless. No president in any era operating under any set of circumstances has managed to pass a complete legislative agenda, and the combination of partisan polarization, an entrenched House GOP majority, and the extremely ambitious nature of Sanders\\'s agenda makes it totally inconceivable that a Sanders administration would pass all of its policy proposals.\\n\\nAsking what would happen if the entire Sanders agenda is enacted is a little like asking what would happen if Sanders brought his mid-range game to the Golden State Warriors. To the extent that anyone is backing Sanders because they have read Friedman\\'s paper, the fact that none of this is going to happen is a bigger problem than any questions about Friedman\\'s forecasts.\\n\\nHowever, on another level, the Friedman paper and the attacks on it from Democratic Party wonks are an interesting window into how the primary is playing out behind the scenes. Clinton has achieved such overwhelming party insider support that the Sanders campaign is largely cut off from access to the kind of para-party policy wonk universe that would allow Sanders to release campaign proposals that pass muster by the traditional rules of the game.\\n\\nBut he\\'s managed to make a virtue out of this weakness and harness it to the larger significance of the Sanders project \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an effort to turn the Democratic Party into a more ideological party that operates more like a progressive mirror image of the conservative Republican Party and less of a broad coalition of interest groups mediated by technocrats.\\n\\nThe headline conclusion of Friedman\\'s paper is that under Bernienomics, \"the growth rate of the real gross domestic product will rise from 2.1% per annum to 5.3% so that real GDP per capita will be over $20,000 higher in 2026 than is projected under the current policy.\"\\n\\nThat is a very high rate of growth.\\n\\nWhen Jeb Bush promised 4 percent growth, centrist-to-liberal economists were derisive, and even the most Jeb-friendly economists wouldn\\'t quite endorse the claim. Friedman is promising even more than that, and the CEA letter reflects a similar level of skepticism.\\n\\nI asked Dean Baker from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, one of the more left-wing and Sanders-friendly economists in the Washington policy world, what he thought of the 5.3 percent target. He, in the nicest possible way, suggested it is unrealistic:\\n\\nObviously opinions differ considerably about the merits of various aspects of Sanders\\'s agenda. But it\\'s on these questions of slack, full employment, and labor force growth where Friedman departs most clearly from the economic consensus.\\n\\nConsider this chart, laying out Friedman\\'s view of how Bernienomics will impact the employment rate, or the share of the adult population that has a job:\\n\\nReasonable people can (and will) disagree about how Sanders\\'s plans would impact the labor market. But virtually every expert I\\'ve ever discussed this with believes that one reason the employment rate has declined since 1999 is that old people are a larger share of the population today than they were 17 years ago. The main reason the CBO expects the employment rate to fall in the future is that this aging process is set to continue. This means the \"full employment\" level of employment is simply lower than it was in the past.\\n\\nFriedman, by contrast, appears to believe that the full employment level is right where it was in the waning days of the Clinton administration, and that with good policy we can get back there.\\n\\nFriedman does not, however, discuss the demographic change issue at all in his paper. Instead, in a footnote he argues that \"women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employment will be encouraged by the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will raise the wages of women, encouraging more to seek paid employment.\" No empirical evidence is offered that such a modest piece of legislation will have an impact this large, nor is much made of the fact that a large share of the growth benefit of the Sanders agenda is being attributed to this consensus Democratic policy, rather than to his more unusual positions.\\n\\nConversely, some of Sanders\\'s more distinctive signature ideas would almost certainly depress labor force participation even in a sympathetic view.\\n\\nFor example, if you made college free, some young people who would otherwise work full time would instead go to school and work part time. Some students who currently work part time would reduce their hours or cut back to zero. A proponent of free college would likely describe these as benefits of the free college universe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and certainly foreign countries where college is much cheaper than the United States see fewer school-age people in the labor force.\\n\\nBy the same token, Sanders\\'s \"Medicare for all\" and expanded Social Security plans would almost certainly increase the number of people who retire early. Free health care would make it easier to be retired for a year or five before Social Security benefits kick in, more generous Social Security would reduce the amount of intact savings people need once the benefits do kick in, and the higher taxes to finance the Medicare-for-all plan would make working slightly less lucrative.\\n\\nNone of that is necessarily a bad thing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 reducing old people\\'s need to toil is a very nice idea \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but, like free college, it tends to cut against Friedman\\'s view that Bernienomics will create a surge of employment.\\n\\nIt\\'s noteworthy that the former CEA chairs criticizing Friedman didn\\'t bother to run through a detailed explanation of their problems with the paper. To them, the 5.3 percent figure was simply absurd on its face, and it was good enough for them to say so, relying on their authority to generate media coverage.\\n\\nAnd to an extent, mission accomplished. The coverage has been generated. But for better or for worse, the entire premise of the Sanders campaign is that the existing Democratic Party establishment needs to be overthrown, so imperious dismissals by establishment figures don\\'t really hurt Sanders. His policy director, Warren Gunnels, told Danielle Kurtzleben that the economists in question are \"the establishment of the establishment\" and claimed to be unbothered by the criticisms.\\n\\n\"That does not bother us at all,\" he told her. \"What bothers us is the fact that the U.S. has more kids living in poverty than nearly any major country on earth.\"\\n\\nBernie sympathizers like the Week\\'s Ryan Cooper and veteran left-wing political operative Jeff Hauser simply view the letter signers as non-credible, referring to an old Goolsbee column and to Tyson\\'s service on corporate boards.\\n\\nTo Sanders skeptics, this style of response is itself worrying. Paul Krugman, for example, wrote about the letter and said, \"If your response to these concerns is that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all corrupt, all looking for jobs with Hillary, you are very much part of the problem.\"\\n\\nThe dismissals of the critiques of Friedman\\'s praise for Sanders\\'s plan are, in a way, more telling and informative than either the Friedman paper or the critiques of it. Sanders and his core constituency simply don\\'t care.\\n\\nSanders is running a style of campaign that\\'s very unusual for a prominent Democrat but extremely common for a Republican. Marco Rubio, for example, has proposed a large tax cut, a balanced budget amendment, an increase in defense spending, and to prevent any cuts in Social Security or Medicare for people currently at or near retirement.\\n\\nThis is, obviously, not possible, but it hasn\\'t been a problem for Rubio in the GOP primary because the 2016 GOP primary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like the 2012, 2008, 2000, 1996, and 1988 primaries \\xe2\\x80\\x94 haven\\'t been about who has the best policy plans. It is about how conservative ideology should be defined and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 among those who share a similar definition \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who is its most effective champion. The 1980 and 1976 GOP primaries were about whether the Republican Party should be a vehicle of the conservative movement or whether it should continue in the Eisenhower/Nixon/Ford model of right-leaning interest group brokerage \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with the conservatives winning in 1980 and never letting go.\\n\\nDemocrats for almost all of this time have not defined themselves as a mirror image of the conservative GOP. Instead, they are a left-leaning coalition of interest groups looking for group wins that tends to downplay ideology. This is why, historically, evaluating \"plans\" has been a very important part of Democratic politics.\\n\\nSanders\\'s campaign against Hillary Clinton is more like Ronald Reagan\\'s battle with Gerald Ford than like the Obama-Clinton primary of 2008. As part of his political revolution, Sanders wants to change the Democratic Party (which he historically was not even a member of) into a much more ideological political party. Consequently, for Sanders the point of taking policy positions is much more about showing where he stands and who his friends and enemies are than it is about the details of policymaking. What he would actually do as president, after all, is going to be constrained by political realities and his ability to mobilize the public\\n\\nTo Sanders\\'s critics, of course, this is just gross irresponsibility that neglects the best traditions of the Democratic Party and raises serious questions about Sanders\\'s ability to do serious policy analysis when the time comes to make choices. But to his fans, fetishizing wonky details is just a way of circumscribing policy proposals to what can be uncontroversially modeled in a world where obtaining and deploying concrete political power \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not drawing up more and better white papers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is the crucial task for progressive politics.'\n",
            " b'Donald J. Trump enters the general election campaign laboring under the worst financial and organizational disadvantage of any major party nominee in recent history, placing both his candidacy and his party in political peril. Mr. Trump began June with just $1. 3 million in cash on hand, a figure more typical for a campaign for the House of Representatives than the White House. He trailed Hillary Clinton, who raised more than $28 million in May, by more than $41 million, according to reports filed late Monday night with the Federal Election Commission. He has a staff of around 70 people  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   compared with nearly 700 for Mrs. Clinton  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   suggesting only the barest effort toward preparing to contest swing states this fall. And he fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Monday, after concerns among allies and donors about his ability to run a competitive race. The Trump campaign has not aired a television advertisement since he effectively secured the nomination in May and has not booked any advertising for the summer or fall. Mrs. Clinton and her allies spent nearly $26 million on advertising in June alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, pummeling Mr. Trump over his temperament, his statements and his mocking of a disabled reporter. The only sustained reply, aside from Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gibes at rallies and on Twitter, has come from a pair of groups that spent less than $2 million combined. Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s   for May reflects his lag in assembling the core of a national finance team. In the same month that he clinched the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump raised just $3. 1 million and was forced to lend himself $2 million to meet costs. Some invitations to Trump   events have featured the same short list of national Republican finance volunteers regardless of what city the event is held in, suggesting Mr. Trump has had some trouble lining up local  . A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an inquiry about the campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spending plans. During an interview on Monday on CNN, Mr. Lewandowski defended the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s   approach. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are leaner, meaner, more efficient, more effective. Get bigger crowds. Get better coverage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lewandowski said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf this was the business world, people would be commending Mr. Trump for the way he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s run this campaign. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d But the shortfall is leaving Mr. Trump extraordinarily dependent on the Republican National Committee, which has seen record   this campaign cycle and, long before Mr. Trump even declared his upstart candidacy, had begun investing heavily in a   plan to bolster the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s technical and organizational capacity. In a first for a major party nominee, Mr. Trump has suggested he will leave the crucial task of field organizing in swing states to the Republican National Committee, which typically relies on the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nominee to help fund, direct and staff national Republican political efforts. His decision threatens to leave the party with significant shortfalls of money and manpower: On Monday, the party reported raising $13 million during May, about a third of the money it raised in May 2012, when Mitt Romney led the ticket. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a waterfall,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Brian O. Walsh, a Republican campaign strategist. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are things that have to happen, and someone has to pay for them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cash crunch marks a stark reversal from the 2012 presidential campaign, which seemed to inaugurate a new era of virtually unlimited money in American politics, buoyed by the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Citizens United decision two years earlier. By the same point that year, President Obama and Mr. Romney were raising tens of millions of dollars per month with their parties. And while Mr. Romney faced a larger deficit overall against Mr. Obama in June 2012, he was raising far more money than Mr. Trump is now, with big donors flocking to his cause. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe campaign has got to be the entity that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out there driving the   car,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Austin Barbour, a lobbyist who served as national finance   of the Romney campaign. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it better be a big old Cadillac. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump has defied conventional wisdom before, clinching the Republican nomination with a small organization and modest outlays on television. And Republican officials believe they are well prepared to compensate for Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s late start. The Republican National Committee has more than 500 field staff members on the ground in swing states, far more than in 2012, and a robust digital and data operation. Allies of Mr. Trump say they believe the tide is already turning. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump will appear at a     in New York City hosted by some of the most prominent names on Wall Street.   for Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said they were now hoping to raise up to $500 million in joint efforts with the Republican National Committee, or an average of $100 million a month from June through October. He is now reliably raising between $5 million and $7 million in each city where he raises money, those donors said. A joint   effort with Mr. Trump and 11 state Republican parties yielded the Republican National Committee $3 million in just five days at the end of May. Some of the largest checks came from a handful of wealthy Trump supporters who are not party mainstays, suggesting Mr. Trump could tap new sources of campaign money. But Mr. Romney was also backed by expansive network of   \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuper PACs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and other outside groups that collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to elect him. This year, the Democrats are leading in outside money. Priorities USA Action, a group focused on advertising in support of Mrs. Clinton, announced on Monday that it had raised $12 million in May and had $52 million on hand  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   a huge reserve. The outside spending effort to help Mr. Trump, by contrast, has been chaotic and underfunded, hampered by a profusion of competing groups, one of which has spent only $1 million so far on Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behalf. The most prominent group, Great America, is advised by Ed Rollins, who managed Ronald Reagan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1984 campaign, and other more seasoned Republican operatives. But it, too, has had difficulty persuading big donors: On Monday, it reported raising just $1. 4 million during the month of May.   efforts for Mr. Trump have been hampered by the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own erratic public comments. He has repeatedly said he will pay for his own campaign even as his volunteers fan out around the country to solicit   checks, confusing allies and potential donors alike. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo days ago, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I may fund it myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rollins said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDonors are all being cautious about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen here. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",
            " b'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With a hug and a handshake, President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe opened a new chapter in U.S.-Japan relations on Friday with Trump abruptly setting aside campaign pledges to force Tokyo to pay more for U.S. defense aid. The two leaders appeared to have established a quick friendship during a day of talks at the White House and a flight together aboard Air Force One to Florida for a weekend of golf. At a joint news conference with Abe, Trump avoided repeating harsh campaign rhetoric that accused Japan of taking advantage of U.S. security aid and stealing American jobs. It was a welcome affirmation for Japan in the face of challenges such as China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maritime expansion and North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear and missile development. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bond between our two nations and the friendship between our two peoples runs very, very deep. This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added. A joint U.S.-Japanese statement said the U.S. commitment to defend Japan through nuclear and conventional military capabilities is unwavering. The statement amounted to a victory for Abe, who came to Washington wanting to develop a sense of trust and friendship with the new U.S. president and send a message that the decades-old alliance is unshakeable. Japan got continued U.S. backing for its dispute with Beijing over islands in the East China Sea that China also claims. The statement said the two leaders affirmed that Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan security treaty covered the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. Abe invited Trump for a visit to Japan this year and Trump accepted. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will make an early stop in Tokyo. But uncertainty remained in another area, that of trade, after Trump abruptly pulled the United States out of the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Abe said he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully aware\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to withdraw from the multilateral trade accord. But he said Japan and the United States had agreed on a new framework for economic dialogue. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am quite optimistic that ... good results will be seen from the dialogue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, adding that Japan was looking for a fair, common set of rules for trade in the region.  A senior Japanese government spokesman said Abe and Trump did not discuss currency issues and that Trump did not request a bilateral trade deal.  The official told reporters that a U.S.-Japan economic dialogue will be led by Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso and Vice President Mike Pence to address fiscal and monetary policies as well as infrastructure projects and trade. Trump, who spoke by phone on Thursday night with Chinese President Xi Jinping, also said he considered dealing with North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear program a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery very high priority\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but gave no hint as to how his approach would differ from that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. He predicted a level playing field on trade with China soon. The Mar-a-Lago visit will be Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first use of his Florida getaway for diplomatic purposes. It will also be the most time Trump will have spent with a foreign leader since taking power last month and his second face-to-face meeting with a key ally after talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May two weeks ago. Trump hosted Abe at Trump Tower last year in his first talks with a foreign leader after his surprise win in the November presidential election. Abe played down his chances in scoring better than Trump in golf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy scores in golf are not up to the level of Donald at all, but my policy is never up, never in, always aiming for the cup,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.  Japan has had lingering concerns about what Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-styled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerica First\\xe2\\x80\\x9d strategy means for U.S. foreign policy in Asia as well as what his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact means for bilateral economic ties.     Abe pledged Japan would help create U.S. jobs, hoping to persuade Trump to turn down the heat on economic matters and stand by the alliance. To avoid questions about whether Japan is paying Trump for Abe to stay at the beachfront Mar-a-Lago retreat, the White House declared that the entire visit there, including golf, is the official gift for Abe from Trump.

In comparison to Washington s other weapons trafficking exploits, like Operation Fast & Furious, this one is even more reckless, dangerous, totally unethical   and completely illegal. Back in 2011, President Obama green-lighted one of the CIA s worst ever operations   one which resulted in a five year-long flood of weapons, ammunition   right into the hands of  moderate  terrorist fighters running wild in Syria.In total, hundreds of millions in US taxpayer funds have been spent on arming terrorists in Syria. This is no accident. Obama assured Arab monarchs that the US would supply the weapons for the proxy war in Syria.The twisted logic and naive optimism of Washington elites was such that they were convinced that these terrorists would eventually bring Syria to its knees and topple the government in Damascus   enabling the US-led  coalition  to divide up Syria and rules over a protracted period of chaos in the region, not caring about the  collateral damage  they have caused along the way.Somehow, we are meant be believe that the current US President really cares about gun control, and yet here he is   running point one of the largest illegal weapons-tracking operations in history, and not a crocodile tear is shed for any of the hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrian lives that have been lost because of this criminal US policy.This is proof that the US has been actively undermining the ceasefire in Syria, but it s only the tip of iceberg  IHS Janes 360Documents released by the US government s Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website have provided an indication of the types and numbers of Eastern European weapons and ammunition the United States is providing to Syrian rebel groups as part of a programme that continues despite the widely respected ceasefire in that country.[The following manifest was make available through official channels]The FBO has released two solicitations in recent months looking for shipping companies to transport explosive material from Eastern Europe to the Jordanian port of Aqaba on behalf of the US Navy s Military Sealift Command.Released on 3 November 2015, the first solicitation sought a contractor to ship 81 containers of cargo that included explosive material from Constanta in Bulgaria to Aqaba.The solicitation was subsequently updated with a detailed packing list that showed the cargo had a total weight of 994 tonnes, a little under half of which was to be unloaded at Agalar, a military pier near the Turkish town of Tasucu, the other half at Aqaba.The cargo listed in the document included AK-47 rifles, PKM general-purpose machine guns, DShK heavy machine guns, RPG-7 rocket launchers, and 9K111M Faktoria anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW) systems. The Faktoria is an improved version of the 9K111 Fagot ATGW, the primary difference being that its missile has a tandem warhead for defeating explosive reactive armour (ERA) fitted to some tanks.READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files'\n",
            " b'DETROIT (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump praised Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N) on Monday for announcing new investments in the United States after he made U.S. auto production a key part of his campaign. Ford announced last week it would abandon plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and would invest $700 million in a Michigan plant over four years, while Fiat Chrysler said Sunday it will invest $1 billion and add 2,000 jobs at plants in Ohio and Michigan to build new SUVs and pickup trucks. Both companies have said they made the decision for business reasons and not because of pressure from Trump, but praised the president-elect for seeking to improve the climate for businesses to operate in the United States. Fiat Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne said at the Detroit auto show on Monday that the decision had been in the works for a long time and was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoincidental\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet last week criticizing the company. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t twist ourselves into a pretzel (to make this decision)... It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a preemptive strike against a tweet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Marchionne said during a roundtable discussion. Marchionne was asked about tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose on vehicles imported to the United States from Mexico and elsewhere and he said that Fiat Chrysler will live with any new rules. However, he added that it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquite possible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that heavy tariffs on Mexican imports could force the company to close Mexican plants. Trump, a real estate developer who takes office on Jan. 20, has repeatedly singled out companies in the auto sector and other industries for not doing more to keep jobs in the United States. Trump, a Republican, also criticized Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) last week for shifting production of its Corolla from Canada to Mexico. The company has said there is no impact on U.S. employment as a result of the change. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said in a tweet on Monday. In a follow up tweet, he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFord said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C(hrysler).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ford announced on Monday it will build the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup at its Wayne assembly plant but will shift production of its Ford Focus car. Because of low demand, it will shift the Focus to an existing Mexican factory, rather than to a new factory as was announced in April. '\n",
            " b'In fact, the U.S. Justice Department has been actively prosecuting two other Abedin family members   for conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud   and she along with the State Department, where she previously worked for Clinton, are mentioned in the federal case, court records show.Other documents reveal the same allegedly crooked kin solicited Abedin for help at State in a deal that netted more than $1.2 million in federal grants.These undesirable family connections, revealed here for the first time, raise fresh questions about influence peddling at the State Department under Clinton, who is now reportedly working with Abedin on a political comeback.Abedin s relatives were major donors to the Clinton Foundation. And Abedin drew a salary from the Clinton Foundation, while at the same time working for the government.Records show that her first cousin, Omar Amanat, is under federal indictment for cheating investors in Kit Digital Inc. of millions of dollars between 2009 and 2012, forcing the tech start-up to go bankrupt in 2013. He has been placed under house arrest as he awaits trial, which is scheduled for Oct. 2.Prosecutors say Omar Amanat illegally diverted millions of dollars from investments in Kit Digital  for his personal use,  including  luxury properties in Manhattan.  He  never disclosed these misappropriations to investors,  who were misled about the value of the company by false balance sheets. He has pleaded not guilty.Recent letters, Part 1 and Part 2 here, from attorneys for Omar and another co-defendant asking the judge to ease their detention reveal that Omar once warned Huma while she was at the State Department that she and other family members were under threat of being  hurt  by  special collection agents  trying to recover stolen funds. Court exhibits reveal that Omar was worried about Huma s safety and contacted the State Department to make her  aware of this incident. Moreover, Kit Digital appears in State Department emails sent to Abedin from Amanat and a business partner. In June 2009, not long after starting Kit Digital and just months after his cousin was named deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Clinton, Amanat helped his business partner solicit Abedin for State favors on behalf of Soliya Inc., which was in partnership with Kit Digital. Summit Entertainment, a film company Amanat held a controlling stake in at the time, also stood to benefit. Thanks for getting in touch. Would love to arrange a meeting,  Abedin replied in a June 23, 2009, email to Amanat and Shamil Idriss, who heads New York-based Soliya Inc.Amanat took KIT Digital public in August 2009.At the time, Amanat, known as a  serial swindler,  was in personal bankruptcy and being sued by other investors. Despite his reputation, he still managed to gain special access to the government thanks to his ties to his well-positioned cousin and the Clinton Foundation.Records show that Amanat and several other family members and related charities have together donated as much as $1.2 million to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, as well as the Clinton Health Access Initiative.Amanat, who personally contributed as much as $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation, was appointed to the Council on Foreign Relations during the time that Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of state.While the FBI has closed its espionage investigation into Clinton s unsecured private email server, its public corruption investigation into the Clinton Foundation remains open. It s not clear if this still-active probe overlaps with the Amanat fraud investigation. However, investigators reportedly continue to look into alleged  pay-for-play  schemes involving the Clinton State Department and the Clinton Foundation and its wealthy donors, as well as entities that paid the Clintons millions of dollars in speaking fees.Judicial Watch and other government watchdog groups have charged that the Clinton Foundation was a pay-for-play operation that rewarded its benefactors with State Department favors.Meanwhile, Abedin s estranged husband, former Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, remains under federal investigation for child pornography.Omar and Huma, who are related through their mothers, who are sisters, have also maintained a long and close-knit relationship.Property and financial records show that in 1999, when Huma was in Washington working as a White House aide to then-first lady Clinton, Omar used her D.C. condo as one of the addresses for another of his start-ups, Tradescape Corp.After Omar Amanat sold Tradescape to E-Trade in 2002 for $100 million in stock, he started the Amanat Family Support Trust, which names cousins as well as immediate family members as beneficiaries   meaning Huma Abedin would stand to benefit from his family trust.Read entire story here  WND'\n",

They are committing brutal atrocities against Christian communities in Syria and Iraq, persecuting religious minorities and destroying entire towns and local economies. Christians are fleeing their homes in increasing numbers, creating an exploding refugee crisis that will have grave ramifications on the stability and security of the entire region.\\n\\nWhile the world has been rightly outraged by the violence waged by ISIS against people of all sects, ethnicities, and religions, the United States, Europe and other key allies have done little to end ISIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s systematic efforts to drive-out and eradicate entire religious communities from their historic and sacred homelands. The Obama Administration has repeatedly refused to defend religious freedom abroad and continues to ignore its devastating cost to those religious communities targeted by terrorists because of their religious beliefs.\\n\\nAs a nation founded in the pursuit of religious freedom, America can and must do more to root-out the religious intolerance that is helping to foster much of the political instability and violence we see today. Specifically, we believe the Obama Administration should integrate the protection of religious freedom into its overall response to growing terrorist threats and development efforts around the world. Doing so would help to eliminate the underlying causes of violent extremism, promote increased international economic stability, and foster greater respect for human rights.\\n\\nPromoting religious freedom would, first and foremost, undermine the efforts of terrorist organizations such as ISIS to capitalize on simmering religious intolerance to build influence and wield power. ISIS has succeeded in tearing apart the social fabric of local communities and exacerbating sectarian and ethnic divisions to recruit supporters from disaffected populations and assert control over wide swaths of otherwise insecure territory. As a result, they have precipitated a breakdown of basic order that has allowed new and unprecedented security threats to the United States and our allies to fester and grow.\\n\\nThe Obama administration can counter this strategy by building alliances with popular local and regional leaders who can expose these radical ideologies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 moral bankruptcy and champion pluralism and tolerance. The Administration should also combat terrorist propaganda about religious minorities and develop programs that promote tolerance and empower minorities to better advocate for their rights and interests. Only by reaffirming the importance of religious freedom and working closely with communities and their governments will we be able to strip away sympathy and support for ISIS and other extremist groups that is bred from deeper political, economic, and social grievances.\\n\\nProperly designed and implemented, a U.S. foreign policy committed to religious freedom can advance our national security interests, stabilize and consolidate the spread of democracy across the globe, help sustain economic growth, and promote the equality of men and women.\\n\\nMost importantly, it can help prevent religiously-motivated terrorism and undermine the conditions that have helped spur the rise of groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, and the Shuddhikaran Movement.\\n\\nPromoting religious freedom would also support the governance structures necessary for economic and political security in developing nations. As recent studies by groups such as the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation have found, higher levels of religious freedom are associated with higher levels of economic productivity and growth. Clearly, sustainable political and economic development is only possible when religious freedom and equal opportunity contributes to a secure environment in which citizens and businesses can operate freely.\\n\\nFinally, we must remain committed to religious freedom because of the special distinction religious freedom holds as a fundamental human right\\xe2\\x80\\x94a belief that is shared by democratic countries across the globe and protected by numerous international treaties and agreements.\\n\\nAmerican support for religious liberty sends a potent and unmistakable message to threatened communities around the world: America is your friend. Such support builds enduring good will towards our country among those who could be leading their own nations in the years ahead. And it reminds all observers, whether friendly or hostile, that the U.S. remains committed to a world where justice and human dignity are central to legitimate governance.\\n\\nRepublican John McCain is a Navy veteran.

            " b'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Leaders of France, Italy and the United Kingdom urged social media companies on Wednesday to more swiftly remove  terrorist content  from the internet, with the aim of stopping it from being uploaded in the first place.  The tech companies have made significant progress on this issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online,  British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly of world leaders in New York. She said there was a need  to increase significantly the efforts to stop (extremist content) being uploaded in the first place.  French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni later pushed in a separate event hosted by May for such content to be removed swiftly.  This is what must be done. In one hour the content must be identified, analyzed and withdrawn to avoid it being broadcast widely. Experience shows that this is possible,  said Macron, speaking through an interpreter.  We have a real battlefield for hearts and minds and (it) is the web,  Gentiloni said. He said economic and privacy issues were a hurdle in this process,  but we also have to know, if we are aware of the fact that this battlefield is so relevant, that we can t reduce our ambition because of the difficulties.  Several websites across the internet list ingredients for making bombs or instructions on how to use vehicles to attack pedestrians. Online retailer Amazon.com said on Wednesday it was reviewing its website after an investigation found it could help users buy the ingredients to make a bomb using its  Frequently bought together  and  Customers who bought this also bought  features. The European Union has threatened legislation if internet companies do not better police what is available on the web.  Removing all of this content within a few hours - or indeed stopping it from appearing on the internet in the first place - poses an enormous technological and scientific challenge,  said Kent Walker, general counsel for Alphabet Inc s Google.  The haystacks here are unimaginably large and the needles are both very small and constantly changing.  Walker spoke on behalf of Facebook Inc, Microsoft Corp, Google subsidiary YouTube and Twitter Inc, all members of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism created in June under pressure from governments in Europe and the United States after a spate of militant attacks. Its aim is to share technical solutions for removing extremist content and work more closely with counter-terrorism experts. Walker said between August 2015 and June 2017, Twitter had suspended almost a million accounts for the promotion of terrorism, and that the use of technology and artificial intelligence had allowed Facebook to root out  terrorist clusters.

            " b'The last thing any politician running for the presidency needs is negative or scandalous hashtags about them trending on Twitter. However, that is just what America is waking up with regards to GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz. You see, overnight, rumors began circulating that Ted Cruz has been cheating on his wife   with MULTIPLE women. Of course, those are just rumors at this time, apparently started by The National Enquirer, and there is certainly no proof. But in the age of the internet, that doesn t matter.Ted Cruz is a creepy guy who nobody likes, so of course people on both the left and right are having a field day over this one. Here are just a few choice tweets from the #CruzSexScandal hashtag:Hey @tedcruz what were you doing on @ashleymadison? Is the #CruzSexScandal a reflection of your values? pic.twitter.com/V4UlIfSWYR  Princip (@3princip) March 25, 2016The only thing that surprises me about the #CruzSexScandal is that it was with women.

Obviously some think it s true, while others think it s a bogus smear job. Either way, the thing about it is this: if the rumors really are true, this isn t about what Cruz or anyone else chooses to do in the bedroom. It s about the hypocrisy of going all in on the whole  family values  platform and judging and discriminating against other as a matter of policy and practice. If these religious bigots weren t so high and mighty and self righteous, nobody would care who they choose to crawl into bed with or anything else in their personal lives. But, when they politicize sex, they bring this on themselves when these sorts of scandalous rumors start flying.Good luck with this one, Ted.

            " b'The state of Virginia refuses to track the number of refugees it resettles who are diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). [This refusal continues even as the number of cases diagnosed in the state has increased for two consecutive years, from 180 in 2013  \\xe2\\x80\\x94    the year former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe, a staunch Clinton ally, was elected governor  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   to 198 in 2014, the year he took office, to 212 in 2015, the last year for which data is available.  The percentage of   cases of TB in Virginia has increased from 74 percent in 2013 (147 out of 180) to 79 percent in 2015 (168 out of 212) well above the national average of 66 percent in 2015 (6, 350 out of 9, 536). In the Centers for Disease Control\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (CDC) Reported Tuberculosis in the United States, 2015, those 6, 350   cases of TB were broken down into the following categories of immigration status upon arrival: But the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) does not think it should be a priority to track   TB cases by category, as do 44 states who have provided the CDC with that data since 2012 (Tennessee became the 45th state to do so in 2014) in its annual Report on Tuberculosis in the United States. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Virginia Department of Health does not collect the data you have requested,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a spokesperson for VDH responded when Breitbart asked to know the immigration status upon first entry of the 168   residents of Virginia diagnosed with active TB in 2015. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen the revised Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis was adopted in 2009, the additional variables regarding immigration status were not required by CDC to be collected. The Virginia Department of Health TB program did not consider this information a priority for surveillance, since it already collected country of origin and arrival date for foreign born people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the spokesperson responded when Breitbart asked why Virginia fails to provide the data 45 other states do to the CDC. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe collect surveillance data to track tuberculosis in Virginia and to prioritize our prevention efforts. All refugees and B1 immigrants are evaluated for TB when they enter the country and if they have disease they will be treated. Prompt treatment for active disease is the primary intervention public health has to control tuberculosis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the spokesperson answered when asked why Virginia does not consider the information a priority for surveillance, though 45 other states and the CDC do, adding: As you can see from the national data available not very many refugees are diagnosed with tuberculosis once they get here. In Virginia, the number would be insignificant and it would not contribute to planning or thinking about prevention efforts, therefore collecting that information was not a priority for surveillance. Every state has different populations and different approaches to data collection within a general framework provided by the CDC. As a result each state and indeed even at the county and city level the focus will be based on what the risks are among the population in that location. (emphasis added) The spokesperson did not respond when Breitbart asked for evidence to support the assertion that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c not very many refugees are diagnosed with tuberculosis once they get here. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The overwhelming evidence presented in numerous medical reports shows exactly the opposite \\xe2\\x80\\x94  the per capita rate of active TB among refugees is much higher than the per capita rate in the general population, and by an order of magnitude. The rate of TB among the general population was 3. 0 per 100, 000 in 2015. In contrast, the estimated rate of TB among refugees nationally exceeded 20 cases per 100, 000 refugees that same year (409 cases diagnosed in 45 reporting states where an estimated two million refugees reside). In states where   cases of TB are significantly above the national average, like Virginia, the estimated rate of TB among refugees is even higher. McAuliffe has been a   advocate of open borders and refugees. In November 2015 he very publicly refused to ask the Obama administration to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGov. Terry McAuliffe said Tuesday that he would veto any attempt by the General Assembly to block Syrian refugees from coming to the state, dismissing the idea as \\xe2\\x80\\x98political posturing\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Richmond. com reported at the time. The number of Syrian refugees resettled in the state by the Obama administration increased significantly after that statement, from 21 in the three years between FY 2013 and FY 2015, to 196 in FY 2016, according to the Department of State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interactive website.   Syrian refugees have been resettled in Virginia in the first three months of FY 2017. Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problem with   TB began before McAuliffe was elected governor in 2013. In 2002, for instance,   TB cases were only 60 percent of all TB cases in  the state. Since then, a total of 19, 213 refugees have been resettled in the state, according to the Department of State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interactive website. In 2007, an influx of refugees from high TB burden countries like Bhutan and Burma began. In the four years between FY 2003 and FY 2006, 117 refugees were resettled in Virginia from Burma. In the four subsequent years, FY 2007 to FY 2010, 969 refugees were resettled from Burma. In the five years between FY 2003 and FY 2007, no refugees were resettled in Virginia from Bhutan. In the five subsequent years, FY 2008 to FY 2012, 2, 233 refugees were resettled from Bhutan. Virginia does, however, track country of origin for   TB cases. In 2015, 23 of Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 168   cases of TB were from the Philippines, 17 were from Viet Nam, 17 were from India, seven were from Haiti, five were from Mexico, one was from China, and 98 were from \\xe2\\x80\\x9call other\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 136 countries. Very few of the 69, 933 refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2015 arrived from the Philippines, Viet Nam, India, Haiti, Mexico, or China. The vast majority \\xe2\\x80\\x94  99 percent, or 69, 843 out of 69, 933 \\xe2\\x80\\x94  arrived from the 136 countries in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9call other\\xe2\\x80\\x9d category. (69, 843 out of 69, 933). In FY 2016, 99 percent of the refugees resettled in the United States (84, 878 out of 84, 995) arrived from the 136 countries in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9call other\\xe2\\x80\\x9d category, according to the Department of State.'\n",
            " b'JERUSALEM  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   A bomb exploded on a bus in Jerusalem on Monday, wounding about 21 people and feeding a sense of vulnerability among many Israelis after months of simmering violence. The sights and sounds were familiar: Television images of a   hulk of a bus and wailing sirens, immediately reminding many Israelis of the second Palestinian uprising, which erupted in 2000, when suicide bombers blew up buses in Jerusalem and other Israeli cities, killing scores. Attacks on buses have been rare in recent years. Describing the blast as a terrorist attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose image as Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security czar has been dented in recent months, vowed to track down those responsible. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will find whoever prepared that explosive device, we will get to those who sent it and we will also get to those who stand behind them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will settle accounts with those terrorists. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The bombing came as many Israelis were already on edge after a   wave of stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks by Palestinians that have killed about 30 people. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during that period, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli officials say that most of the Palestinians were killed while carrying out, or attempting, attacks, and that others were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces. Unlike the major assaults of the second uprising, which were engineered by the main Palestinian groups, most of the recent attacks appear to be the almost spontaneous work of by individuals. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are in an ongoing battle against terrorism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Netanyahu said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cterrorism of knives, terrorism of shootings, of bombs, of rockets and even of tunnels. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was referring to a tunnel that the Israeli military said on Monday it had discovered and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneutralized. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Running from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, it was the first such tunnel found since a   ended 50 days of fighting in the Palestinian coastal territory in summer 2014. Mr. Netanyahu hailed the discovery, saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe State of Israel has achieved a global breakthrough in the ability to locate tunnels. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d He described the breakthrough as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunique,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but did not provide any details about the technology involved. The military said the tunnel had been built 100 to 130 feet underground by Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza that it could have been used for terrorist attacks against Israeli border communities and that it was equipped with electricity and communications lines. Israeli officials have said in recent months that Hamas had most likely rebuilt much of the tunnel network that was damaged by Israel during the   war. The officials also said Hamas was trying to restock its rocket supplies. The threat of the tunnels continues to sow fear in Israeli communities along the border. Some residents have reported hearing digging underground. Feeding those anxieties, Hamas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military wing said in a statement that the recently discovered tunnel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis only a drop in the ocean of resistance preparations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meant to defend the Palestinians. Hamas also praised the Jerusalem bus bombing on Monday, without claiming responsibility for it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe bless the   operation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the organization wrote on its Twitter account, using the Arabic name for Jerusalem. The details of the bus explosion on Monday emerged slowly. The blast came shortly before 6 p. m. in Moshe Baram Street, by the Talpiot industrial zone in southeast Jerusalem. A fire caused by the explosion spread quickly to a second bus, but the police said it was not immediately clear whether the blaze was the result of a bomb or caused by a mechanical flaw. More than two hours later, Yoram Halevy, the Jerusalem district police chief, said in a televised statement that a bomb had caused the blast, but the police were cautious about determining if it involved terrorism, or crime. Mr. Halevy said the police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the blast, including whether one of the people who was wounded had brought the bomb onto the bus. Two victims were in serious condition. The identity of at least one of the wounded was still unknown hours after the blast, Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said. Mr. Rosenfeld said the police were investigating how the bomb got onto the bus, and if it was meant to go off there or was intended for another location. Racheli Dadon, a Jerusalem resident, described from her hospital bed how she had boarded the No. 12 bus with her daughter, Eden, 15. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had not even sat down when I heard a huge blast and all the glass fell on us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told the Israelie news site Ynet. She said she searched for her daughter amid smoke and darkness, finding her with burns all over her body. The driver of the No. 12 bus, Moshe Levy, said he had inspected the vehicle twice before setting out on his route. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe whole way was fine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got to Baram Street in Talpiot and stopped in a traffic jam. I heard a blast in the back portion of the bus and I opened the doors and told people to exit the bus. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prof. Avraham Rivkind, head of the trauma unit at the Hadassah Medical Center in Ein Kerem, on the southwestern edge of Jerusalem, said the hospital received several of the wounded who had suffered burns as well as injuries from nails and bolts  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwounds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat are familiar to us from past events in our city. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Also on Monday, Israeli military prosecutors filed a manslaughter charge against a soldier who fatally shot a Palestinian assailant in the West Bank city of Hebron last month as he lay on the ground, wounded and subdued. The military court lifted an order banning the publication of the name of the soldier, Sgt. Elor Azaria, from Ramle, in central Israel, and said his trial, in a military court, would begin on May 9.'\n",

            " b'RIYADH (Reuters) - The failed North Korean missile test over the weekend was an attempt by the reclusive country to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprovoke something,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday, pledging that the  United States will work with China to reduce tensions.  U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programmes seen by Washington and others as a direct threat. On Saturday North Korea carried out a missile launch which the Pentagon said failed, blowing up almost immediately . Speaking with reporters on his way to the Middle East, Mattis said the most recent test was not an intercontinental ballistic missile but still a reckless move. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt shows why we are working so closely right now with the Chinese... to try to get this under control and aim for the denuclearized Korean peninsula,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mattis said. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that the softer line he had taken on China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management of its currency was linked to its help on North Korea. The United States, its allies and China are working on a range of responses to North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s missile test, U.S. officials have said. China itself has spoken out against the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weapons tests and has supported U.N. sanctions.  It banned imports of North Korean coal on Feb. 26, cutting off its most important export and Chinese media has raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to North Korea if it unleashed more provocations. On Monday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence put North Korea on notice, warning that recent U.S. strikes in Syria and Afghanistan showed that the Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resolve should not be tested. The Trump administration is focusing its strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including an oil embargo, a global ban on its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. The North has warned of a nuclear strike against the United States if provoked. It has said it has developed and would launch a missile that can strike the mainland United States but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead.

And in November, when Solange appeared on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaturday Night Live,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a backstage video posted on Instagram, showing the singer carried by Mom and Big Sis, caused the internet to let out a collective \\xe2\\x80\\x9caww. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lawson, 63, now finds herself in a newfound role as an artistic bridge between two of 2016\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most critically lauded albums: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLemonade,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fiery visual album that is up for nine nods at the Grammy Awards next month, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Seat at the Table,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Solange\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spare and poetic RB record, which topped Pitchfork\\xe2\\x80\\x99s   list last year. In October, her daughters made history when they became the first sisters to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart in the same year. The shadow of Ms. Lawson, a former Southern beautician who is a lifelong collector of black contemporary art, hovers over the artsy allusions in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLemonade\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to intergenerational   motherhood, marital strife and their family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deep Creole roots. On the agitpop single \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFormation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 shouts out her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMomma Louisiana. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The   Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 broke her silence to talk about her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creative influence (though on email, coordinated through a publicist). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it was important to my mother to surround us with positive, powerful, strong images of African and   art so that we could reflect and see ourselves in them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mother has always been invested in making women feel beautiful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether it was through someone sitting in her hair chair or making a prom dress for one of the girls at church. And her art collection always told the stories of women wanting to do the same. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lawson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Seat at the Table\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is more explicit. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTina Taught Me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a cerebral     interlude, she sermonizes about black cultural pride, saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always been proud to be black. Never wanted to be nothing else. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d She also says it \\xe2\\x80\\x9csaddens\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her when people considers that to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cantiwhite. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Solange said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe says things in that interlude that I had been trying to say for the last four years. But my mother has a very special way of communicating, a very special channel that she speaks through that has always felt bigger than her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf my sister and my project feels like an \\xe2\\x80\\x98awakening\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to some,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am constantly saying that we both grew up in a home with two words: Tina Knowles. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The matriarch of pop music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reigning family resides (rather fittingly for a woman who once posed on the cover of Ebony wearing a gold crown) in a gated, castlelike home atop the winding Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. On a warm evening in late November, Ms. Lawson sat in her brightly colored living room, filled with postimpressionist and abstract works, mostly by African and   artists. Dressed casually in an   ensemble, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Tina\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   as she likes to be called  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   is all natural warmth and poise. She may have nurtured two supernatural superstar daughters, but she comes across as a sage retiree supremely at ease in her dewy, flawless skin. She offered a tour of works by Henry Ossawa Tanner and Elizabeth Catlett that hang   on her walls, saying that her children \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrew up surrounded by art and feeling proud about who they are. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d She is also a goofball in person. Stepping out to her large outdoor balcony overlooking the twinkling skyline, she said her two favorite places to shop were Home Depot and Costco. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI meet people every day that are like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You come here? \\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course, I do. \\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her irreverent side is familiar to her nearly one million followers on Instagram, a platform hardly known as welcoming to   women in their 60s. She cracks dorky mom jokes  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told my assistant to have a really great day, and you know what she did? She went home!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   impersonates Tina Turner and generally clowns around with her friends and family. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to show people the regularity of my life, and that not everything is so fancy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. Her fans can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get enough. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not following Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mom on Instagram, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re missing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d declared an article from Harper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bazaar in August. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s auntie who is a sweetheart, but still keeps it real when necessary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Crissle West, a   of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Read,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a popular podcast on   and pop culture. Ms. Lawson, nee Celestine Ann Beyinc\\xc3\\xa9, grew up in the 1950s in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca real small town\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Galveston, Tex. The last of seven siblings, her father was a longshoreman and her mother was a seamstress. She picked up dressmaking at a young age, creating sparkly stage outfits for her   singing group while in high school. At 19, she moved to California to work as a makeup artist for Shiseido Cosmetics (she learned styling tricks from drag queens, she said) but returned to Texas a year later when her parents fell ill. With help from her   Matthew Knowles, a former Xerox executive, she opened a   hair salon in Houston called Headliners. The salon, which had more than a   run, helped the Knowles family afford an   lifestyle. It was also an impromptu stage for her young brood, while women under dryers acted as judges. When Destiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Child, the girl group whose most famous lineup consisted of Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9, Kelly Rowland (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy other daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and Michelle Williams, began to break out in the late 1990s, Ms. Lawson returned to dressmaking and whipped up matching cutaway Boy Scout uniforms,   camouflage hot pants and   fur sheaths for the group to wear onstage. As Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 put it in her Council of Fashion Designers of America speech last year, designers were reluctant to dress \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack country curvy girls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so her mother stepped in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey looked a little crazy sometimes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lawson said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut people always wondered what they were going to wear next. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBootylicious\\xe2\\x80\\x9d touch helped the group stand out. Destiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Child went on to sell over 60 million records worldwide, and Destiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother became a fashion force. In 2004, she and Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 started the House of Der\\xc3\\xa9on, a trendy,   clothing brand named after Ms. Lawson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother. A juniors collection, bedding and a clothing line aimed at older women called Miss Tina soon followed. When the group disbanded in 2005, Ms. Lawson continued to create showstoppers for Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 as a solo artist, including the black brocade ball gown she wore for the 2005 Academy Awards. But in 2009, just when her professional life seemed to be at its peak, Ms. Lawson said her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworld completely stopped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d After 33 years of marriage, she filed for divorce from Mr. Knowles, who had been a talent manager for their daughters. Citing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconflict of personalities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in court papers, the divorce was made final in 2011. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI kind of lost myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll these things that I love  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   going to art shows, reading art books, going out dancing  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   I had stopped. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really loving yourself, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not taking care of yourself in terms of your needs and what makes you happy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The split raised existential questions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of life was I going to have now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lawson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought it was too late for me to try something new. You have all these doubts in your mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d In search of answers, she closed all her fashion businesses and, at 59, left Houston for Los Angeles for what she jokingly said was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca new house, a new car, a new man and a new life. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d In 2013, she reconnected with an old friend, Richard Lawson, a TV actor known for his roles in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDynasty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll My Children. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The couple tied the knot two years later. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just feel so liberated now, I really do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. Ms. Lawson now focuses much of her time on black female empowerment issues and philanthropy (she was honored at the Essence Festival in New Orleans last year) and she is writing an autobiography she says is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c      book. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d She and her husband plan to open in March an acting workshop for underserved youth in Los Angeles, called the WACO Theater Center (short for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere Art Can Occur\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). And after her   break from fashion, she designed the gold fringe outfit that Solange wore in her music video \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCranes in the Sky,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as well as the white dress Solange wore for her performance at former President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s farewell party at the White House on Jan. 6. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe day I had kids, I thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I might screw everything else up, but not this,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lawson said, flashing a knowing smile as she sat, regally postured, on her sofa. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re grown women, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my turn. \\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",

Their campaign has emphasized economic issues and the soaring cost of living.\\n\\n[Read: A guide to the political parties battling for Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future]\\n\\nNetanyahu charged in a radio interview Sunday that hostile Israeli journalists and shadowy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforeign powers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were behind an anti-Netanyahu campaign that could be his undoing.\\n\\nLivni, his longtime rival and the former justice minister, countered that Netanyahu was panicking and looking for scapegoats.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe citizens of Israel will replace Netanyahu, not because of what is written in the newspapers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said Sunday, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have enough money to buy a newspaper\\xc2\\xa0.\\xe2\\x80\\x89.\\xe2\\x80\\x89. or buy apartments for their children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Netanyahu campaign assumed the prime minister would get a bump in support after his speech before a joint meeting of Congress two weeks ago, when he\\xc2\\xa0directly challenged President Obama and warned that the United States was about to sign a disastrous pact that would not halt Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear ambitions.\\n\\n[Read: Why Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top right-winger wants his people to \\xe2\\x80\\x98stop apologizing\\xe2\\x80\\x99]\\n\\nHis supporters boasted of his Churchillian skills as a master orator.

During the campaign, Netanyahu also distanced himself from peace talks. He vowed there would be no concessions or withdrawals from the West Bank and suggested that the two-state solution was no longer relevant.\\n\\nBoth may be sailing into contrary winds. The last polls for Israel Army Radio found that more than half of Israelis surveyed plan to vote based on social and economic issues and that fewer than 1 in 3 put security at the top of their concerns.

            " b'The U. S. Supreme Court has declined to hear Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 appeal from an adverse ruling in the Texas voter ID case. [The Texas Attorney General said after the U. S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear the case, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile we are disappointed that the U. S. Supreme Court did not immediately take our case, Chief Justice Roberts made it very clear that the case will be an even stronger posture for Supreme Court review after further proceedings in lower courts. Texas enacted a common sense voter ID law to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and we will continue to fight for the law in the district court, the Fifth Circuit, and if necessary, the Supreme Court again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Breitbart Texas reported the day before the U. S. Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order denying review of the case that a federal magistrate delayed the next hearing in the Texas voter ID case so that the Trump Administration would have time to discuss the case with the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers. Federal lawyers filed a motion for continuance on Friday, January 20, asking the court to continue a hearing that had originally been set for January 24. In an effort to temporarily address the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscriminatory effects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the law as originally written, the trial court enforced a remedy shortly before the 2016 Election that allowed voters without proper ID to sign affidavits attesting to the reason why they could not obtain one before casting a regular ballot. Harris County Clerk Stan Stanart, who runs Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 largest voting jurisdiction, told Breitbart on Sunday, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe flawed solution pushed by the DOJ that we were forced to use last November allowed hundreds of illegal votes to be cast in Harris County. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d The latest Supreme Court ruling sets the stage for the   lawsuit to continue down a track that could take many more months to resolve. The State of Texas is not without other options outside of the courtroom, however. Public Interest Legal Foundation President J. Christian Adams told Breitbart Texas that legislators can take the job of fixing the law into their own hands. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Texas Legislature is also free to offer reforms that could serve to fix the \\xe2\\x80\\x98discriminatory effects\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the law. A fix would be easy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Adams noted. In July 2016, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 voter ID law had a discriminatory effect under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act but said the district court erred in finding discriminatory intent, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The   en banc ruling held that the law did not constitute a poll tax, either. The appellate court remanded the case to the district court to determine if the voter ID provisions were written to be intentionally discriminatory. The dissents to the opinion encompassed 100 pages. Judge Edith Jones, a Reagan nominated judge, wrote a dissent which was joined by four others.

By 0 48 \\nYou can condemn that semi-isolationist \\xe2\\x80\\x98America First\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mindset if you want, but the easiest way to prevent the next world war is simply to let the Russians have what they want, provided it makes no difference to you. \\nLike Donald Trump or not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I like him no more than, well, Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there is one thing he might be good for. Peace. A small matter, I know, when set against his serial (alleged) philandering and worse, but worth pondering for a moment. A hideous, but necessary thought experiment runs something like this. \\nWhat is the single most important relationship the United States of America could build to secure world peace? Why, the same one that, when it goes horribly wrong, leaves us all sliding towards testing the doctrine of mutually assured destruction in a nuclear age. Always a bit mad to end up there. Yes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, the most important relationship is with the Russians , or, as we once knew them, the Soviets. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the ones we need to get along with. \\nNow this is where The Donald scores above his sensible, sane, intelligent and diplomatic Democratic opponent. Donald gets it. He gets that if you decide to run your foreign policy devoid of moral content with the sole guiding principle that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enemy is my friend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (copyright Joseph Stalin), then peace, cooperation, even alliance with Russia is possible, indeed desirable. \\nCurrent Prices on popular forms of Silver Bullion \\nThe Russians, more than a little cynically, have asked the West for decades to join them in a war against \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIslamist terrorism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, but which they principally mean the separatist movements in Chechnya and elsewhere. Donald Trump is the first presidential contender, more even than George W Bush, who looks like he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d actually want to take them up on the offer. Trump is fixated to the point of racism on the militant Islamist violence that he tells his fearful audience is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust around the corner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It is all too easy to imagine a state visit by Vladimir Putin to Washington where he is feted and falls into the arms (we hope no more) of an affectionate President Trump. The US-Russia Strategic Partnership would be the fruit of that particular liaison, with secret provisions, no doubt, on assassinating terrorist leaders, and public pledges on intelligence sharing, with the whole relationship consummated by series of joint bombing raids in Syria. They would share a goal to destroy Isis, even though they have not been able to do so recently, because it would be part of a wider cooperation. Such would be the new world order.'\n",
            " b\"Johnny Depp will not be voting for Donald Trump, judging from the award-winning actor s comments during a recent sit-down Q&A at Arizona State University on Saturday.The Q&A was focused around the methods Depp uses in his acting, but the actor couldn t help but go off on a Trump rant while speaking with theoretical physicist and Arizona State University s Origins Project founder Lawrence Krauss about  humanity in madness. Depp didn t mince his words as he railed against the GOPer, calling him a  brat.  Depp began by stating that he didn t think the candidate s offensive behavior was merely a result of  him being a rich kid.  Depp added,  There s something creative about him in a sense of bullydom  before ultimately coming to the conclusion that  What he is, I believe, is a brat. Depp also commented on Trump s raunchy, brash language by stating how interesting it was to follow the absurdity of where his sentences might travel.  Depp continued: Reagan back in the day,  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall!  Donald Trump,  I m going to build a wall. And all of my billions are not going to have to pay for it. Because you know why? Mexico is going to pay for it.' What follows after those thoughts is one of the most amazing, dead-on Trump impressions by the actor, which the audience went absolutely wild for. You can watch Depp go in on Trump below:Depp has attacked Trump before, and seems to have his impression of him down pat. Last month, Depp impersonated the business mogul in a hilarious Funny Or Die video that was based on Trump s bestselling book The Art of the Deal.Depp is just the latest person to join the droves of celebrities speaking out against Trump. Just this weekend, singer John Legend also publicly railed against the Republican front runner when he called Trump out on Twitter. Trump has also recently been condemned by Louis C.K., Miley Cyrus, George Clooney, and Stephen King  and we don t blame these celebrities for doing everything they can to wake Americans up. As long as Trump has a chance at the White House, America is in big trouble and we need everyone to speak up against him. Featured image via video screen capture\"\n",

            " b'Donald Trump loves talking about email scandals, apparently   so then why hasn t he mentioned the millions of emails  lost  by the Bush administration? On April 27, 2007, an estimated five million emails relevant to an ongoing investigation of eight U.S. attorneys being fired were lost. As it turns out that number is closer to 22 million.The New York Times reported:WASHINGTON, April 11   Political advisers to President Bush may have improperly used their Republican National Committee e-mail accounts to conduct official government business, and some communications that are required to be preserved under federal law may be lost as a result, White House officials said Wednesday.Of the 1,000 White House officials with political duties, 22   including Karl Rove, the chief political strategist   have Republican National Committee accounts that are supposed to be used only for campaign-related work.So, while Hillary Clinton has got plenty of attention for emails she lost, the media has  forgotten  about this scandal by the Bush administration. Big surprise, right? It s not like it s relevant, or anything. Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell also had private email, but we don t talk about that, either. I wonder why? It couldn t have anything to do with the need for ratings, or the need to somehow create a close race between Hillary, who is eminently qualified, and the raging dumpster fire that is Trump, could it?Even more worryingly, many times Cheney s emails were unavailable for weeks at a time, with archives also unavailable. And yet, not a peep from Republicans, and certainly nothing from Donald Trump. It s almost as if, after 30 years of non-scandals failing to go anywhere, they re getting a little bit desperate.Donald Trump, on the other hand, has set the bar lower than ever before when it comes to transparency. He won t release medical records, he won t release tax returns, and he won t reveal his business connections or how he intends to profit from the office of the presidency. His war on the press has made it clear he has no respect for the first amendment or the right to dissent. And his scandals are only just getting started   something tells me investigations of Trump won t be so fruitless.'\n",
            " b'A Muslim faith healer has been arrested for the brutal drugging and stabbing of 20 of his disciples at a Sufi shrine in Punjab, Pakistan. [The victims of the massacre were reportedly drugged with   food, stripped naked and then killed with a dagger and stick. Along with the 20 dead, four more people were wounded in the incident, which occurred around midnight between Saturday and Sunday. The four are in critical condition.  The alleged perpetrator of the crime is the    shrine custodian and faith healer Abdul Waheed, who confessed that he killed these people because he feared that they had come to kill him, according to regional police chief Zulfiqar Hameed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe suspect appears to be paranoid and psychotic, or it could be related to rivalry for the control of shrine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hameed said. Pervaiz Haider, a doctor in the hospital treating the survivors of the incident, said most of the dead were hit on the back of the neck. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are bruises and wounds inflicted by a club and dagger on the bodies of victims,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Waheed was known for erratic behavior but was popular as a faith healer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLocal people say Abdul used to beat the visitors who came to him for treatment of various physical or spiritual ailments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d local rescue service official Mazhar Shah said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes he would remove the clothes of his visitors and burn them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to Deputy Commissioner Liaqut Ali Chatha, people would come to the shrine for cleansing their sins and allow the caretakers to beat them with clubs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in this case the visitors were first drugged and then stabbed with daggers and hit with clubs, apparently during the cleansing process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chatha said. The shrine was built two and a half years ago and named after the late boxer Mohammed Ali, a convert to Islam. It has become a popular place of pilgrimage and healing for Sufi Muslims. Two other suspects were reportedly arrested together with Waheed. Many hardline Muslims regard Sufis as heretics because of the mystical element of their tradition. Earlier this year, militants of the Islamic State ( ) carried out a massive suicide bombing on a prominent Sufi Muslim shrine in Pakistan, killing up to 88 people and wounding more than 300 others. Last November, another Islamic State attack at a Sufi shrine in   Pakistan left a least 52 people dead and more than 100 others injured. A bomb blast hit worshipers participating in a ceremony at the shrine of the Sufi saint Shah Noorani, some 750 kilometers (460 miles) south of Quetta, the provincial capital of restive southern Balochistan province.

            " b'Amazon stock has skyrocketed this week as shares rose above $900 for the first time on Tuesday CNN Money reports. [Amazon stock is riding high with shares gaining 7 percent this week alone and 20 percent overall this year. This values Amazon at around $430 billion, twice the market value of one of its major rivals Walmart which is worth around $220 billion. Currently, the only companies worth more than Amazon are Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Amazon is now worth more than both Facebook and the Warren   Berkshire Hathaway,  This surge in Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price comes after the announcement last week that the company would be buying the Middle Eastern   site Souq. com. Amazon reportedly purchased the company which had been previously valued at around $1 billion for the price of $650 million. Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock is now trading at 125 times the companies estimated earnings this year and 75 times the companies projected profits for next year. Despite the high price of the stock, financial data and software company FactSet still considers the stock a good buy. Two dozen analysts have estimated the stock price target to rise above the current price with seven analysts putting it above $1, 000. Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets raised his price estimation on Monday to $1, 200 while Shyam Patil of Susquehanna Financial Group raised his price target to $1250. These estimations are approximately 40 percent higher than the current market price, if these predictions are proven true, then Amazon could soon hold a market value of nearly $600 billion. Considering the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rapid expansion into technology with their Amazon Alexa home device and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sponsored Products business, Amazon could soon also be dominating the tech and world in the near future.
